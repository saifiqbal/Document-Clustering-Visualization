They urged, therefore, that, with-out direct allusion to the manners of the Eastern tribes, andto the romantic conflicts of the period, the title of a ?Tale ofthe Crusaders? would resemble the playbill, which is said tohave announced the tragedy of Hamlet, the character of thePrince of Denmark being left out. On the other hand, I feltthe difficulty of giving a vivid picture of a part of the worldwith which I was almost totally unacquainted, unless by earlyrecollections of the Arabian Nights? Entertainments; and notonly did I labour under the incapacity of ignorance?inwhich, as far as regards Eastern manners, I was as thicklywrapped as an Egyptian in his fog?but my contemporarieswere, many of them, as much enlightened upon the subjectas if they had been inhabitants of the favoured land ofGoshen. The love of travelling had pervaded all ranks, andcarried the subjects of Britain into all quarters of the world.Greece, so attractive by its remains of art, by its struggles forfreedom against a Mohammedan tyrant, by its very name,where every fountain had its classical legend?Palestine, en-deared to the imagination by yet more sacred remem-brances?had been of late surveyed by British eyes, and de-scribed by recent travellers. Had I, therefore, attempted thedifficult task of substituting manners of my own invention,instead of the genuine costume of the East, almost every trav-eller I met who had extended his route beyond what wasanciently called ?The Grand Tour,? had acquired a right, byocular inspection, to chastise me for my presumption. Everymember of the Travellers? Club who could pretend to havethrown his shoe over Edom was, by having done so, consti-tuted my lawful critic and corrector. It occurred, therefore, 4The Talismanthat where the author of Anastasius, as well as he of HadjiBaba, had described the manners and vices of the Easternnations, not only with fidelity, but with the humour of LeSage and the ludicrous power of Fielding himself, one whowas a perfect stranger to the subject must necessarily pro-duce an unfavourable contrast. The Poet Laureate also, inthe charming tale of ?Thalaba,? had shown how extensivemight be the researches of a person of acquirements and tal-ent, by dint of investigation alone, into the ancient doctrines,history, and manners of the Eastern countries, in which weare probably to look for the cradle of mankind; Moore, inhis ?Lalla Rookh,? had successfully trod the same path; inwhich, too, Byron, joining ocular experience to extensivereading, had written some of his most attractive poems. In aword, the Eastern themes had been already so successfullyhandled by those who were acknowledged to be masters oftheir craft, that I was diffident of making the attempt.These were powerful objections; nor did they lose forcewhen they became the subject of anxious reflection, althoughthey did not finally prevail. The arguments on the other sidewere, that though I had no hope of rivalling the contempo-raries whom I have mentioned, yet it occurred to me as pos-sible to acquit myself of the task I was engaged in withoutentering into competition with them.The period relating more immediately to the Crusadeswhich I at last fixed upon was that at which the warlike char-acter of Richard I., wild and generous, a pattern of chivalry,with all its extravagant virtues, and its no less absurd errors,was opposed to that of Saladin, in which the Christian andEnglish monarch showed all the cruelty and violence of anEastern sultan, and Saladin, on the other hand, displayedthe deep policy and prudence of a European sovereign, whilsteach contended which should excel the other in the knightlyqualities of bravery and generosity. This singular contrastafforded, as the author conceived, materials for a work offiction possessing peculiar interest. One of the inferior char-acters introduced was a supposed relation of Richard Coeurde Lion?a violation of the truth of history which gave of-fence to Mr. Mills, the author of the ?History of Chivalryand the Crusades,? who was not, it may be presumed, awarethat romantic fiction naturally includes the power of suchinvention, which is indeed one of the requisites of the art. 5Sir Walter ScottPrince David of Scotland, who was actually in the host,and was the hero of some very romantic adventures on hisway home, was also pressed into my service, and constitutesone of my dramatis personae.It is true I had already brought upon the field him of thelion heart. But it was in a more private capacity than he washere to be exhibited in the Talisman?then as a disguisedknight, now in the avowed character of a conquering mon-arch; so that I doubted not a name so dear to Englishmen asthat of King Richard I. might contribute to their amuse-ment for more than once.I had access to all which antiquity believed, whether ofreality or fable, on the subject of that magnificent warrior,who was the proudest boast of Europe and their chivalry,and with whose dreadful name the Saracens, according to ahistorian of their own country, were wont to rebuke theirstartled horses. ?Do you think,? said they, ?that King Rich-ard is on the track, that you stray so wildly from it?? Themost curious register of the history of King Richard is anancient romance, translated originally from the Norman; andat first certainly having a pretence to be termed a work ofchivalry, but latterly becoming stuffed with the most aston-ishing and monstrous fables. There is perhaps no metricalromance upon record where, along with curious and genu-ine history, are mingled more absurd and exaggerated inci-dents. We have placed in the Appendix to this Introductionthe passage of the romance in which Richard figures as anogre, or literal cannibal.A principal incident in the story is that from which thetitle is derived. Of all people who ever lived, the Persianswere perhaps most remarkable for their unshaken credulityin amulets, spells, periapts, and similar charms, framed, itwas said, under the influence of particular planets, and be-stowing high medical powers, as well as the means of ad-vancing men?s fortunes in various manners. A story of thiskind, relating to a Crusader of eminence, is often told in thewest of Scotland, and the relic alluded to is still in existence,and even yet held in veneration.Sir Simon Lockhart of Lee and Gartland made a consider-able figure in the reigns of Robert the Bruce and of his sonDavid. He was one of the chief of that band of Scottish chiv-alry who accompanied James, the Good Lord Douglas, on 6The Talismanhis expedition to the Holy Land with the heart of King Rob-ert Bruce. Douglas, impatient to get at the Saracens, enteredinto war with those of Spain, and was killed there. Lockhartproceeded to the Holy Land with such Scottish knights ashad escaped the fate of their leader and assisted for sometime in the wars against the Saracens.The following adventure is said by tradition to have be-fallen him:?He made prisoner in battle an Emir of considerable wealthand consequence. The aged mother of the captive came to theChristian camp, to redeem her son from his state of captivity.Lockhart is said to have fixed the price at which his prisonershould ransom himself; and the lady, pulling out a large em-broidered purse, proceeded to tell down the ransom, like amother who pays little respect to gold in comparison of herson?s liberty. In this operation, a pebble inserted in a coin,some say of the Lower Empire, fell out of the purse, and theSaracen matron testified so much haste to recover it as gavethe Scottish knight a high idea of its value, when comparedwith gold or silver. ?I will not consent,? he said, ?to grant yourson?s liberty, unless that amulet be added to his ransom.? Thelady not only consented to this, but explained to Sir SimonLockhart the mode in which the talisman was to be used, andthe uses to which it might be put. The water in which it wasdipped operated as a styptic, as a febrifuge, and possessed otherproperties as a medical talisman.Sir Simon Lockhart, after much experience of the wonderswhich it wrought, brought it to his own country, and left itto his heirs, by whom, and by Clydesdale in general, it was,and is still, distinguished by the name of the Lee-penny, fromthe name of his native seat of Lee.The most remarkable part of its history, perhaps, was thatit so especially escaped condemnation when the Church ofScotland chose to impeach many other cures which savouredof the miraculous, as occasioned by sorcery, and censuredthe appeal to them, ?excepting only that to the amulet, calledthe Lee-penny, to which it had pleased God to annex certainhealing virtues which the Church did not presume to con-demn.? It still, as has been said, exists, and its powers aresometimes resorted to. Of late, they have been chiefly re-stricted to the cure of persons bitten by mad dogs; and as theillness in such cases frequently arises from imagination, there 7Sir Walter Scottcan be no reason for doubting that water which has beenpoured on the Lee-penny furnishes a congenial cure.Such is the tradition concerning the talisman, which theauthor has taken the liberty to vary in applying it to his ownpurposes.Considerable liberties have also been taken with the truthof history, both with respect to Conrade of Montserrat?s life,as well as his death. That Conrade, however, was reckonedthe enemy of Richard is agreed both in history and romance.The general opinion of the terms upon which they stoodmay be guessed from the proposal of the Saracens that theMarquis of Montserrat should be invested with certain partsof Syria, which they were to yield to the Christians. Richard,according to the romance which bears his name, ?could nolonger repress his fury. The Marquis he said, was a traitor,who had robbed the Knights Hospitallers of sixty thousandpounds, the present of his father Henry; that he was a ren-egade, whose treachery had occasioned the loss of Acre; andhe concluded by a solemn oath, that he would cause him tobe drawn to pieces by wild horses, if he should ever ventureto pollute the Christian camp by his presence. Philip at-tempted to intercede in favour of the Marquis, and throw-ing down his glove, offered to become a pledge for his fidel-ity to the Christians; but his offer was rejected, and he wasobliged to give way to Richard?s impetuosity.??History ofChivalry.Conrade of Montserrat makes a considerable figure in thosewars, and was at length put to death by one of the followersof the Scheik, or Old Man of the Mountain; nor did Rich-ard remain free of the suspicion of having instigated his death.It may be said, in general, that most of the incidents intro-duced in the following tale are fictitious, and that reality,where it exists, is only retained in the characters of the piece.Abbotsford, 1st July, 1832 8The TalismanAppendix to Introduction.While warring in the Holy Land, Richard was seized with anague.The best leeches of the camp were unable to effect the cureof the King?s disease; but the prayers of the army were moresuccessful. He became convalescent, and the first symptomof his recovery was a violent longing for pork. But pork wasnot likely to be plentiful in a country whose inhabitants hadan abhorrence for swine?s flesh; and?Though his men should be hanged,They ne might, in that countrey,For gold, ne silver, ne no money,No pork find, take, ne get,That King Richard might aught of eat.An old knight with Richard biding,When he heard of that tiding,That the kingis wants were swyche,To the steward he spake privyliche??Our lord the king sore is sick, I wis,After porck he alonged is;Ye may none find to selle;No man be hardy him so to telle!If he did he might die.Now behoves to done as I shall say,Tho? he wete nought of that.Take a Saracen, young and fat;In haste let the thief be slain,Opened, and his skin off flayn;And sodden full hastily,With powder and with spicery,And with saffron of good colour.When the king feels thereof savour,Out of ague if he be went,He shall have thereto good talent.When he has a good taste,And eaten well a good repast,And supped of the brewis [Broth] a sup,Slept after and swet a drop,Through Goddis help and my counsail,Soon he. shall be fresh and hail.? 9Sir Walter ScottThe sooth to say, at wordes few,Slain and sodden was the heathen shrew.Before the king it was forth brought:Quod his men, ?Lord, we have pork sought;Eates and sups of the brewis soote,[Sweet]Thorough grace of God it shall be your boot.?Before King Richard carff a knight,He ate faster than he carve might.The king ate the flesh and gnew [Gnawed] the bones,And drank well after for the nonce.And when he had eaten enough,His folk hem turned away, and lough.[Laughed]He lay still and drew in his arm;His chamberlain him wrapped warm.He lay and slept, and swet a stound,And became whole and sound.King Richard clad him and arose,And walked abouten in the close.?An attack of the Saracens was repelled by Richard in person,the consequence of which is told in the following lines :??When King Richard had rested a whyle,A knight his arms ?gan unlace,Him to comfort and solace.Him was brought a sop in wine.?The head of that ilke swine,That I of ate!? (the cook he bade,)?For feeble I am, and faint and mad.Of mine evil now I am fear;Serve me therewith at my soupere!?Quod the cook, ?That head I ne have.?Then said the king, ?So God me save,But I see the head of that swine,For sooth, thou shalt lesen thine!?The cook saw none other might be;He fet the head and let him see.He fell on knees, and made a cry??Lo, here the head! my Lord, mercy!?? 10The TalismanThe cook had certainly some reason to fear that his masterwould be struck with horror at the recollection of the dread-ful banquet to which he owed his recovery; but his fears weresoon dissipated.?The swarte vis [Black face] when the king seeth,His black beard and white teeth,How his lippes grinned wide,?What devil is this?? the king cried,And ?gan to laugh as he were wode.?What! is Saracen?s flesh thus good?That never erst I nought wist!By God?s death and his uprist,Shall we never die for default,While we may in any assault,Slee Saracens, the flesh may take,And seethen and roasten and do hem bake,[And] Gnawen her flesh to the bones!Now I have it proved once,For hunger ere I be wo,I and my folk shall eat mo!??The besieged now offered to surrender, upon conditionsof safety to the inhabitants; while all the public treasure,military machines, and arms were delivered to the victors,together with the further ransom of one hundred thousandbezants. After this capitulation, the following extraordinaryscene took place. We shall give it in the words of the humor-ous and amiable George Ellis, the collector and the editor ofthese Romances:??Though the garrison had faithfully performed the otherarticles of their contract, they were unable to restore the cross,which was not in their possession, and were therefore treatedby the Christians with great cruelty. Daily reports of theirsufferings were carried to Saladin; and as many of them werepersons of the highest distinction, that monarch, at the so-licitation of their friends, dispatched an embassy to KingRichard with magnificent presents, which he offered for theransom of the captives. The ambassadors were persons themost respectable from their age, their rank, and their elo-quence. They delivered their message in terms of the utmosthumility; and without arraigning the justice of the conquerorin his severe treatment of their countrymen, only solicited a 11Sir Walter Scottperiod to that severity, laying at his feet the treasures withwhich they were entrusted, and pledging themselves and theirmaster for the payment of any further sums which he mightdemand as the price of mercy.?King Richard spake with wordes mild.?The gold to take, God me shield!Among you partes [Divide] every charge.I brought in shippes and in barge,More gold and silver with me,Than has your lord, and swilke three.To his treasure have I no need!But for my love I you bid,To meat with me that ye dwell;And afterward I shall you tell.Thorough counsel I shall you answer,What bode [Message] ye shall to your lord bear.?The invitation was gratefully accepted. Richard, in themeantime, gave secret orders to his marshal that he shouldrepair to the prison, select a certain number of the most dis-tinguished captives, and, after carefully noting their nameson a roll of parchment, cause their heads to be instantly struckoff; that these heads should be delivered to the cook, withinstructions to clear away the hair, and, after boiling them ina cauldron, to distribute them on several platters, one to eachguest, observing to fasten on the forehead of each the pieceof parchment expressing the name and family of the victim.??An hot head bring me beforn,As I were well apayed withall,Eat thereof fast I shall;As it were a tender chick,To see how the others will like.??This horrible order was punctually executed. At noon theguests were summoned to wash by the music of the waits.The king took his seat attended by the principal officers ofhis court, at the high table, and the rest of the company weremarshalled at a long table below him. On the cloth wereplaced portions of salt at the usual distances, but neitherbread, wine, nor water. The ambassadors, rather surprised at 12The Talismanthis omission, but still free from apprehension, awaited insilence the arrival of the dinner, which was announced bythe sound of pipes, trumpets, and tabours; and beheld, withhorror and dismay, the unnatural banquet introduced by thesteward and his officers. Yet their sentiments of disgust andabhorrence, and even their fears, were for a time suspendedby their curiosity. Their eyes were fixed on the king, who,without the slightest change of countenance, swallowed themorsels as fast as they could be supplied by the knight whocarved them.?Every man then poked other;They said, ?This is the devil?s brother,That slays our men, and thus hem eats!??Their attention was then involuntarily fixed on the smok-ing heads before them. They traced in the swollen and dis-torted features the resemblance of a friend or near relation,and received from the fatal scroll which accompanied eachdish the sad assurance that this resemblance was not imagi-nary. They sat in torpid silence, anticipating their own fatein that of their countrymen; while their ferocious entertainer,with fury in his eyes, but with courtesy on his lips, insultedthem by frequent invitations to merriment. At length thisfirst course was removed, and its place supplied by venison,cranes, and other dainties, accompanied by the richest wines.The king then apologized to them for what had passed, whichhe attributed to his ignorance of their taste; and assured themof his religious respect for their characters as ambassadors,and of his readiness to grant them a safe-conduct for theirreturn. This boon was all that they now wished to claim; and?King Richard spake to an old man,?Wendes home to your Soudan!His melancholy that ye abate;And sayes that ye came too late.Too slowly was your time y-guessed;Ere ye came, the flesh was dressed,That men shoulden serve with me,Thus at noon, and my meynie.Say him, it shall him nought avail,Though he for-bar us our vitail, 13Sir Walter ScottBread, wine, fish, flesh, salmon, and conger;Of us none shall die with hunger,While we may wenden to fight,And slay the Saracens downright,Wash the flesh, and roast the head.With oo [One] Saracen I may well feedWell a nine or a tenOf my good Christian men.King Richard shall warrant,There is no flesh so nourissantUnto an English man,Partridge, plover, heron, ne swan,Cow ne ox, sheep ne swine,As the head of a Sarazyn.There he is fat, and thereto tender,And my men be lean and slender.While any Saracen quick be,Livand now in this Syrie,For meat will we nothing care.Abouten fast we shall rare,And every day we shall eatAll as many as we may get.To England will we nought gon,Till they be eaten every one.?? 14The TalismanEllis?s Specimens of Early English Metricel Romances.The reader may be curious to know owing to what circum-stances so extraordinary an invention as that which imputedcannibalism to the King of England should have found itsway into his history. Mr. James, to whom we owe so muchthat is curious, seems to have traced the origin of this ex-traordinary rumour.?With the army of the cross also was a multitude of men,?the same author declares, ?who made it a profession to bewithout money. They walked barefoot, carried no arms, andeven preceded the beasts of burden in their march, livingupon roots and herbs, and presenting a spectacle both dis-gusting and pitiable.?A Norman, who, according to all accounts, was of noblebirth, but who, having lost his horse, continued to follow asa foot soldier, took the strange resolution of putting himselfat the head of this race of vagabonds, who willingly receivedhim as their king. Amongst the Saracens these men becamewell known under the name of ThafursTHAFURS (whichGuibert translates Trudentes), and were beheld with great hor-ror from the general persuasion that they fed on the deadbodies of their enemies; a report which was occasionally jus-tified, and which the king of the Thafurs took care to en-courage. This respectable monarch was frequently in the habitof stopping his followers, one by one, in a narrow defile, andof causing them to be searched carefully, lest the possessionof the least sum of money should render them unworthy ofthe name of his subjects. If even two sous were found uponany one, he was instantly expelled the society of his tribe,the king bidding him contemptuously buy arms and fight.?This troop, so far from being cumbersome to the army,was infinitely serviceable, carrying burdens, bringing in for-age, provisions, and tribute; working the machines in thesieges; and, above all, spreading consternation among theTurks, who feared death from the lances of the knights lessthan that further consummation they heard of under theteeth of the Thafurs.? [James?s ?History of Chivalry.?]It is easy to conceive that an ignorant minstrel, finding thetaste and ferocity of the Thafurs commemorated in the his-torical accounts of the Holy Wars, has ascribed their prac-tices and propensities to the Monarch of England, whose 15Sir Walter Scottferocity was considered as an object of exaggeration as legiti-mate as his valour.Abbotsford, 1st July, 1832.TALES OF THE CRUSADERS.TALE II.?THE TALISMAN.CHAPTER I.They, too, retiredTo the wilderness, but ?twas with arms.?Paradise Regained.THE BURNING SUN of Syria had not yet attained its highestpoint in the horizon, when a knight of the Red Cross, whohad left his distant northern home and joined the host of theCrusaders in Palestine, was pacing slowly along the sandydeserts which lie in the vicinity of the Dead Sea, or, as it iscalled, the Lake Asphaltites, where the waves of the Jordanpour themselves into an inland sea, from which there is nodischarge of waters.The warlike pilgrim had toiled among cliffs and precipicesduring the earlier part of the morning. More lately, issuingfrom those rocky and dangerous defiles, he had entered upon 16The Talismanthat great plain, where the accursed cities provoked, in an-cient days, the direct and dreadful vengeance of the Om-nipotent.The toil, the thirst, the dangers of the way, were forgotten,as the traveller recalled the fearful catastrophe which hadconverted into an arid and dismal wilderness the fair andfertile valley of Siddim, once well watered, even as the Gar-den of the Lord, now a parched and blighted waste, con-demned to eternal sterility.Crossing himself, as he viewed the dark mass of rollingwaters, in colour as in duality unlike those of any other lake,the traveller shuddered as he remembered that beneath thesesluggish waves lay the once proud cities of the plain, whosegrave was dug by the thunder of the heavens, or the eruptionof subterraneous fire, and whose remains were hid, even bythat sea which holds no living fish in its bosom, bears noskiff on its surface, and, as if its own dreadful bed were theonly fit receptacle for its sullen waters, sends not, like otherlakes, a tribute to the ocean. The whole land around, as inthe days of Moses, was ?brimstone and salt; it is not sown,nor beareth, nor any grass groweth thereon.? The land aswell as the lake might be termed dead, as producing nothinghaving resemblance to vegetation, and even the very air wasentirely devoid of its ordinary winged inhabitants, deterredprobably by the odour of bitumen and sulphur which theburning sun exhaled from the waters of the lake in steamingclouds, frequently assuming the appearance of waterspouts.Masses of the slimy and sulphureous substance called naph-tha, which floated idly on the sluggish and sullen waves, sup-plied those rolling clouds with new vapours, and affordedawful testimony to the truth of the Mosaic history.Upon this scene of desolation the sun shone with almostintolerable splendour, and all living nature seemed to havehidden itself from the rays, excepting the solitary figure whichmoved through the flitting sand at a foot?s pace, and ap-peared the sole breathing thing on the wide surface of theplain. The dress of the rider and the accoutrements of hishorse were peculiarly unfit for the traveller in such a coun-try. A coat of linked mail, with long sleeves, plated gauntlets,and a steel breastplate, had not been esteemed a sufficientweight of armour; there were also his triangular shield sus-pended round his neck, and his barred helmet of steel, over 17Sir Walter Scottwhich he had a hood and collar of mail, which was drawnaround the warrior?s shoulders and throat, and filled up thevacancy between the hauberk and the headpiece. His lowerlimbs were sheathed, like his body, in flexible mail, securingthe legs and thighs, while the feet rested in plated shoes,which corresponded with the gauntlets. A long, broad,straight-shaped, double-edged falchion, with a handle formedlike a cross, corresponded with a stout poniard on the otherside. The knight also bore, secured to his saddle, with oneend resting on his stirrup, the long steel-headed lance, hisown proper weapon, which, as he rode, projected backwards,and displayed its little pennoncelle, to dally with the faintbreeze, or drop in the dead calm. To this cumbrous equip-ment must be added a surcoat of embroidered cloth, muchfrayed and worn, which was thus far useful that it excludedthe burning rays of the sun from the armour, which theywould otherwise have rendered intolerable to the wearer. Thesurcoat bore, in several places, the arms of the owner, al-though much defaced. These seemed to be a couchant leop-ard, with the motto, ?I sleep; wake me not.? An outline ofthe same device might be traced on his shield, though manya blow had almost effaced the painting. The flat top of hiscumbrous cylindrical helmet was unadorned with any crest.In retaining their own unwieldy defensive armour, the North-ern Crusaders seemed to set at defiance the nature of theclimate and country to which they had come to war.The accoutrements of the horse were scarcely less massiveand unwieldy than those of the rider. The animal had a heavysaddle plated with steel, uniting in front with a species ofbreastplate, and behind with defensive armour made to coverthe loins. Then there was a steel axe, or hammer, called amace-of-arms, and which hung to the saddle-bow. The reinswere secured by chain-work, and the front-stall of the bridlewas a steel plate, with apertures for the eyes and nostrils,having in the midst a short, sharp pike, projecting from theforehead of the horse like the horn of the fabulous unicorn.But habit had made the endurance of this load of panoplya second nature, both to the knight and his gallant charger.Numbers, indeed, of the Western warriors who hurried toPalestine died ere they became inured to the burning cli-mate; but there were others to whom that climate becameinnocent and even friendly, and among this fortunate num- 18The Talismanber was the solitary horseman who now traversed the borderof the Dead Sea.Nature, which cast his limbs in a mould of uncommonstrength, fitted to wear his linked hauberk with as much easeas if the meshes had been formed of cobwebs, had endowedhim with a constitution as strong as his limbs, and whichbade defiance to almost all changes of climate, as well as tofatigue and privations of every kind. His disposition seemed,in some degree, to partake of the qualities of his bodily frame;and as the one possessed great strength and endurance, unitedwith the power of violent exertion, the other, under a calmand undisturbed semblance, had much of the fiery and en-thusiastic love of glory which constituted the principal at-tribute of the renowned Norman line, and had rendered themsovereigns in every corner of Europe where they had drawntheir adventurous swords.It was not, however, to all the race that fortune proposedsuch tempting rewards; and those obtained by the solitaryknight during two years? campaign in Palestine had been onlytemporal fame, and, as he was taught to believe, spiritualprivileges. Meantime, his slender stock of money had meltedaway, the rather that he did not pursue any of the ordinarymodes by which the followers of the Crusade condescendedto recruit their diminished resources at the expense of thepeople of Palestine?he exacted no gifts from the wretchednatives for sparing their possessions when engaged in war-fare with the Saracens, and he had not availed himself of anyopportunity of enriching himself by the ransom of prisonersof consequence. The small train which had followed himfrom his native country had been gradually diminished, asthe means of maintaining them disappeared, and his onlyremaining squire was at present on a sick-bed, and unable toattend his master, who travelled, as we have seen, singly andalone. This was of little consequence to the Crusader, whowas accustomed to consider his good sword as his safest es-cort, and devout thoughts as his best companion.Nature had, however, her demands for refreshment andrepose even on the iron frame and patient disposition of theKnight of the Sleeping Leopard; and at noon, when the DeadSea lay at some distance on his right, he joyfully hailed thesight of two or three palm-trees, which arose beside the wellwhich was assigned for his mid-day station. His good horse, 19Sir Walter Scotttoo, which had plodded forward with the steady enduranceof his master, now lifted his head, expanded his nostrils, andquickened his pace, as if he snuffed afar off the living waterswhich marked the place of repose and refreshment. But labourand danger were doomed to intervene ere the horse or horse-man reached the desired spot.As the Knight of the Couchant Leopard continued to fixhis eyes attentively on the yet distant cluster of palm-trees, itseemed to him as if some object was moving among them.The distant form separated itself from the trees, which partlyhid its motions, and advanced towards the knight with aspeed which soon showed a mounted horseman, whom histurban, long spear, and green caftan floating in the wind, onhis nearer approach showed to be a Saracen cavalier. ?In thedesert,? saith an Eastern proverb, ?no man meets a friend.?The Crusades was totally indifferent whether the infidel, whonow approached on his gallant barb as if borne on the wingsof an eagle, came as friend or foe?perhaps, as a vowed cham-pion of the Cross, he might rather have preferred the latter.He disengaged his lance from his saddle, seized it with theright hand, placed it in rest with its point half elevated, gath-ered up the reins in the left, waked his horse?s mettle withthe spur, and prepared to encounter the stranger with thecalm self-confidence belonging to the victor in many con-tests.The Saracen came on at the speedy gallop of an Arab horse-man, managing his steed more by his limbs and the inflec-tion of his body than by any use of the reins, which hungloose in his left hand; so that he was enabled to wield thelight, round buckler of the skin of the rhinoceros, ornamentedwith silver loops, which he wore on his arm, swinging it as ifhe meant to oppose its slender circle to the formidable thrustof the Western lance. His own long spear was not couchedor levelled like that of his antagonist, but grasped by themiddle with his right hand, and brandished at arm?s-lengthabove his head. As the cavalier approached his enemy at fullcareer, he seemed to expect that the Knight of the Leopardshould put his horse to the gallop to encounter him. But theChristian knight, well acquainted with the customs of East-ern warriors, did not mean to exhaust his good horse by anyunnecessary exertion; and, on the contrary, made a dead halt,confident that if the enemy advanced to the actual shock, 20The Talismanhis own weight, and that of his powerful charger, would givehim sufficient advantage, without the additional momen-tum of rapid motion. Equally sensible and apprehensive ofsuch a probable result, the Saracen cavalier, when he hadapproached towards the Christian within twice the length ofhis lance, wheeled his steed to the left with inimitable dex-terity, and rode twice around his antagonist, who, turningwithout quitting his ground, and presenting his front con-stantly to his enemy, frustrated his attempts to attack himon an unguarded point; so that the Saracen, wheeling hishorse, was fain to retreat to the distance of a hundred yards.A second time, like a hawk attacking a heron, the heathenrenewed the charge, and a second time was fain to retreatwithout coming to a close struggle. A third time he ap-proached in the same manner, when the Christian knight,desirous to terminate this illusory warfare, in which he mightat length have been worn out by the activity of his foeman,suddenly seized the mace which hung at his saddle-bow, and,with a strong hand and unerring aim, hurled it against thehead of the Emir, for such and not less his enemy appeared.The Saracen was just aware of the formidable missile in timeto interpose his light buckler betwixt the mace and his head;but the violence of the blow forced the buckler down on histurban, and though that defence also contributed to deadenits violence, the Saracen was beaten from his horse. Ere theChristian could avail himself of this mishap, his nimblefoeman sprung from the ground, and, calling on his steed,which instantly returned to his side, he leaped into his seatwithout touching the stirrup, and regained all the advantageof which the Knight of the Leopard hoped to deprive him.But the latter had in the meanwhile recovered his mace, andthe Eastern cavalier, who remembered the strength and dex-terity with which his antagonist had aimed it, seemed to keepcautiously out of reach of that weapon of which he had solately felt the force, while he showed his purpose of waging adistant warfare with missile weapons of his own. Plantinghis long spear in the sand at a distance from the scene ofcombat, he strung, with great address, a short bow, which hecarried at his back; and putting his horse to the gallop, oncemore described two or three circles of a wider extent thanformerly, in the course of which he discharged six arrows atthe Christian with such unerring skill that the goodness of 21Sir Walter Scotthis harness alone saved him from being wounded in as manyplaces. The seventh shaft apparently found a less perfect partof the armour, and the Christian dropped heavily from hishorse. But what was the surprise of the Saracen, when, dis-mounting to examine the condition of his prostrate enemy,he found himself suddenly within the grasp of the Euro-pean, who had had recourse to this artifice to bring his en-emy within his reach! Even in this deadly grapple the Saracenwas saved by his agility and presence of mind. He unloosedthe sword-belt, in which the Knight of the Leopard had fixedhis hold, and, thus eluding his fatal grasp, mounted his horse,which seemed to watch his motions with the intelligence ofa human being, and again rode off.  But in the last encoun-ter the Saracen had lost his sword and his quiver of arrows,both of which were attached to the girdle which he wasobliged to abandon. He had also lost his turban in thestruggle.These disadvantages seemed to incline the Moslem to atruce. He approached the Christian with his right hand ex-tended, but no longer in a menacing attitude.?There is truce betwixt our nations,? he said, in the linguafranca commonly used for the purpose of communicationwith the Crusaders; ?wherefore should there be war betwixtthee and me? Let there be peace betwixt us.??I am well contented,? answered he of the Couchant Leop-ard; ?but what security dost thou offer that thou wilt ob-serve the truce???The word of a follower of the Prophet was never broken,?answered the Emir. ?It is thou, brave Nazarene, from whomI should demand security, did I not know that treason sel-dom dwells with courage.?The Crusader felt that the confidence of the Moslem madehim ashamed of his own doubts.?By the cross of my sword,? he said, laying his hand on theweapon as he spoke, ?I will be true companion to thee,Saracen, while our fortune wills that we remain in companytogether.??By Mohammed, Prophet of God, and by Allah, God ofthe Prophet,? replied his late foeman, ?there is not treacheryin my heart towards thee. And now wend we to yonder foun-tain, for the hour of rest is at hand, and the stream had hardlytouched my lip when I was called to battle by thy approach.? 22The TalismanThe Knight of the Couchant Leopard yielded a ready andcourteous assent; and the late foes, without an angry look orgesture of doubt, rode side by side to the little cluster ofpalm-trees.CHAPTER II.TIMES OF DANGER have always, and in a peculiar degree, theirseasons of good-will and security; and this was particularlyso in the ancient feudal ages, in which, as the manners of theperiod had assigned war to be the chief and most worthyoccupation of mankind, the intervals of peace, or rather oftruce, were highly relished by those warriors to whom theywere seldom granted, and endeared by the very circumstanceswhich rendered them transitory. It is not worth while pre-serving any permanent enmity against a foe whom a cham-pion has fought with to-day, and may again stand in bloodyopposition to on the next morning. The time and situationafforded so much room for the ebullition of violent passions,that men, unless when peculiarly opposed to each other, orprovoked by the recollection of private and individual wrongs,cheerfully enjoyed in each other?s society the brief intervalsof pacific intercourse which a warlike life admitted.The distinction of religions, nay, the fanatical zeal whichanimated the followers of the Cross and of the Crescentagainst each other, was much softened by a feeling so natural 23Sir Walter Scottto generous combatants, and especially cherished by the spiritof chivalry. This last strong impulse had extended itself gradu-ally from the Christians to their mortal enemies the Saracens,both of Spain and of Palestine. The latter were, indeed, nolonger the fanatical savages who had burst from the centre ofArabian deserts, with the sabre in one hand and the Koranin the other, to inflict death or the faith of Mohammed, or,at the best, slavery and tribute, upon all who dared to op-pose the belief of the prophet of Mecca. These alternativesindeed had been offered to the unwarlike Greeks and Syr-ians; but in contending with the Western Christians, ani-mated by a zeal as fiery as their own, and possessed of asunconquerable courage, address, and success in arms, theSaracens gradually caught a part of their manners, and espe-cially of those chivalrous observances which were so well cal-culated to charm the minds of a proud and conqueringpeople. They had their tournaments and games of chivalry;they had even their knights, or some rank analogous; andabove all, the Saracens observed their plighted faith with anaccuracy which might sometimes put to shame those whoowned a better religion. Their truces, whether national orbetwixt individuals, were faithfully observed; and thus it wasthat war, in itself perhaps the greatest of evils, yet gave occa-sion for display of good faith, generosity, clemency, and evenkindly affections, which less frequently occur in more tran-quil periods, where the passions of men, experiencing wrongsor entertaining quarrels which cannot be brought to instantdecision, are apt to smoulder for a length of time in the bo-soms of those who are so unhappy as to be their prey.It was under the influence of these milder feelings whichsoften the horrors of warfare that the Christian and Saracen,who had so lately done their best for each other?s mutualdestruction, rode at a slow pace towards the fountain of palm-trees to which the Knight of the Couchant Leopard had beentending, when interrupted in mid-passage by his fleet anddangerous adversary. Each was wrapt for some time in hisown reflections, and took breath after an encounter whichhad threatened to be fatal to one or both; and their goodhorses seemed no less to enjoy the interval of repose.That of the Saracen, however, though he had been forcedinto much the more violent and extended sphere of motion,appeared to have suffered less from fatigue than the charger 24The Talismanof the European knight. The sweat hung still clammy on thelimbs of the latter, when those of the noble Arab were com-pletely dried by the interval of tranquil exercise, all savingthe foam-flakes which were still visible on his bridle andhousings. The loose soil on which he trod so much augmentedthe distress of the Christian?s horse, heavily loaded by hisown armour and the weight of his rider, that the latter jumpedfrom his saddle, and led his charger along the deep dust ofthe loamy soil, which was burnt in the sun into a substancemore impalpable than the finest sand, and thus gave the faith-ful horse refreshment at the expense of his own additionaltoil; for, iron-sheathed as he was, he sunk over the mailedshoes at every step which he placed on a surface so light andunresisting.?You are right,? said the Saracen?and it was the first wordthat either had spoken since their truce was concluded; ?yourstrong horse deserves your care. But what do you in the desertwith an animal which sinks over the fetlock at every step as ifhe would plant each foot deep as the root of a date-tree???Thou speakest rightly, Saracen,? said the Christian knight,not delighted at the tone with which the infidel criticized hisfavourite steed??rightly, according to thy knowledge andobservation. But my good horse hath ere now borne me, inmine own land, over as wide a lake as thou seest yonder spreadout behind us, yet not wet one hair above his hoof.?The Saracen looked at him with as much surprise as hismanners permitted him to testify, which was only expressedby a slight approach to a disdainful smile, that hardly curledperceptibly the broad, thick moustache which enveloped hisupper lip.?It is justly spoken,? he said, instantly composing himselfto his usual serene gravity; ?List to a Frank, and hear a fable.??Thou art not courteous, misbeliever,? replied the Cru-sader, ?to doubt the word of a dubbed knight; and were itnot that thou speakest in ignorance, and not in malice, ourtruce had its ending ere it is well begun. Thinkest thou I tellthee an untruth when I say that I, one of five hundred horse-men, armed in complete mail, have ridden?ay, and riddenfor miles, upon water as solid as the crystal, and ten timesless brittle???What wouldst thou tell me?? answered the Moslem. ?Yon-der inland sea thou dost point at is peculiar in this, that, by 25Sir Walter Scottthe especial curse of God, it suffereth nothing to sink in itswaves, but wafts them away, and casts them on its margin;but neither the Dead Sea, nor any of the seven oceans whichenviron the earth, will endure on their surface the pressureof a horse?s foot, more than the Red Sea endured to sustainthe advance of Pharaoh and his host.??You speak truth after your knowledge, Saracen,? said theChristian knight; ?and yet, trust me, I fable not, accordingto mine. Heat, in this climate, converts the soil into some-thing almost as unstable as water; and in my land cold oftenconverts the water itself into a substance as hard as rock. Letus speak of this no longer, for the thoughts of the calm, clear,blue refulgence of a winter?s lake, glimmering to stars andmoonbeam, aggravate the horrors of this fiery desert, where,methinks, the very air which we breathe is like the vapour ofa fiery furnace seven times heated.?The Saracen looked on him with some attention, as if todiscover in what sense he was to understand words which, tohim, must have appeared either to contain something of mys-tery or of imposition. At length he seemed determined in whatmanner to receive the language of his new companion.?You are,? he said, ?of a nation that loves to laugh, and youmake sport with yourselves, and with others, by telling what isimpossible, and reporting what never chanced. Thou art oneof the knights of France, who hold it for glee and pastime togab, as they term it, of exploits that are beyond human power.[Gaber. This French word signified a sort of sport much usedamong the French chivalry, which consisted in vying with eachother in making the most romantic gasconades. The verb andthe meaning are retained in Scottish.] I were wrong to chal-lenge, for the time, the privilege of thy speech, since boastingis more natural to thee than truth.??I am not of their land, neither of their fashion,? said theKnight, ?which is, as thou well sayest, to GAB of that whichthey dare not undertake?or, undertaking, cannot perfect. Butin this I have imitated their folly, brave Saracen, that in talk-ing to thee of what thou canst not comprehend, I have, evenin speaking most simple truth, fully incurred the character ofa braggart in thy eyes; so, I pray you, let my words pass.?They had now arrived at the knot of palm-trees and thefountain which welled out from beneath their shade in spar-kling profusion. 26The TalismanWe have spoken of a moment of truce in the midst of war;and this, a spot of beauty in the midst of a sterile desert, wasscarce less dear to the imagination. It was a scene which,perhaps, would elsewhere have deserved little notice; but asthe single speck, in a boundless horizon, which promisedthe refreshment of shade and living water, these blessings,held cheap where they are common, rendered the fountainand its neighbourhood a little paradise. Some generous orcharitable hand, ere yet the evil days of Palestine began, hadwalled in and arched over the fountain, to preserve it frombeing absorbed in the earth, or choked by the flitting cloudsof dust with which the least breath of wind covered the desert.The arch was now broken, and partly ruinous; but it still sofar projected over and covered in the fountain that it ex-cluded the sun in a great measure from its waters, which,hardly touched by a straggling beam, while all around wasblazing, lay in a steady repose, alike delightful to the eye andthe imagination. Stealing from under the arch, they werefirst received in a marble basin, much defaced indeed, butstill cheering the eye, by showing that the place was ancientlyconsidered as a station, that the hand of man had been thereand that man?s accommodation had been in some measureattended to. The thirsty and weary traveller was remindedby these signs that others had suffered similar difficulties,reposed in the same spot, and, doubtless, found their way insafety to a more fertile country. Again, the scarce visible cur-rent which escaped from the basin served to nourish the fewtrees which surrounded the fountain, and where it sunk intothe ground and disappeared, its refreshing presence was ac-knowledged by a carpet of velvet verdure.In this delightful spot the two warriors halted, and each,after his own fashion, proceeded to relieve his horse fromsaddle, bit, and rein, and permitted the animals to drink atthe basin, ere they refreshed themselves from the fountainhead, which arose under the vault. They then suffered thesteeds to go loose, confident that their interest, as well astheir domesticated habits, would prevent their straying fromthe pure water and fresh grass.Christian and Saracen next sat down together on the turf,and produced each the small allowance of store which theycarried for their own refreshment. Yet, ere they severally pro-ceeded to their scanty meal, they eyed each other with that 27Sir Walter Scottcuriosity which the close and doubtful conflict in which theyhad been so lately engaged was calculated to inspire. Eachwas desirous to measure the strength, and form some esti-mate of the character, of an adversary so formidable; andeach was compelled to acknowledge that, had he fallen inthe conflict, it had been by a noble hand.The champions formed a striking contrast to each other inperson and features, and might have formed no inaccuraterepresentatives of their different nations. The Frank seemeda powerful man, built after the ancient Gothic cast of form,with light brown hair, which, on the removal of his helmet,was seen to curl thick and profusely over his head. His fea-tures had acquired, from the hot climate, a hue much darkerthan those parts of his neck which were less frequently ex-posed to view, or than was warranted by his full and well-opened blue eye, the colour of his hair, and of the mous-taches which thickly shaded his upper lip, while his chin wascarefully divested of beard, after the Norman fashion. Hisnose was Grecian and well formed; his mouth rather large inproportion, but filled with well-set, strong, and beautifullywhite teeth; his head small, and set upon the neck with muchgrace. His age could not exceed thirty, but if the effects oftoil and climate were allowed for, might be three or fouryears under that period. His form was tall, powerful, andathletic, like that of a man whose strength might, in laterlife, become unwieldy, but which was hitherto united withlightness and activity. His hands, when he withdrew themailed gloves, were long, fair, and well-proportioned; thewrist-bones peculiarly large and strong; and the arms remark-ably well-shaped and brawny. A military hardihood and care-less frankness of expression characterized his language andhis motions; and his voice had the tone of one more accus-tomed to command than to obey, and who was in the habitof expressing his sentiments aloud and boldly, whenever hewas called upon to announce them.The Saracen Emir formed a marked and striking contrastwith the Western Crusader. His stature was indeed abovethe middle size, but he was at least three inches shorter thanthe European, whose size approached the gigantic. His slen-der limbs and long, spare hands and arms, though well pro-portioned to his person, and suited to the style of his coun-tenance, did not at first aspect promise the display of vigour 28The Talismanand elasticity which the Emir had lately exhibited. But onlooking more closely, his limbs, where exposed to view,seemed divested of all that was fleshy or cumbersome; sothat nothing being left but bone, brawn, and sinew, it was aframe fitted for exertion and fatigue, far beyond that of abulky champion, whose strength and size are counterbal-anced by weight, and who is exhausted by his own exertions.The countenance of the Saracen naturally bore a generalnational resemblance to the Eastern tribe from whom hedescended, and was as unlike as possible to the exaggeratedterms in which the minstrels of the day were wont to repre-sent the infidel champions, and the fabulous descriptionwhich a sister art still presents as the Saracen?s Head uponsignposts. His features were small, well-formed, and deli-cate, though deeply embrowned by the Eastern sun, and ter-minated by a flowing and curled black beard, which seemedtrimmed with peculiar care. The nose was straight and regu-lar, the eyes keen, deep-set, black, and glowing, and his teethequalled in beauty the ivory of his deserts. The person andproportions of the Saracen, in short, stretched on the turfnear to his powerful antagonist, might have been comparedto his sheeny and crescent-formed sabre, with its narrow andlight but bright and keen Damascus blade, contrasted withthe long and ponderous Gothic war-sword which was flungunbuckled on the same sod. The Emir was in the very flowerof his age, and might perhaps have been termed eminentlybeautiful, but for the narrowness of his forehead and some-thing of too much thinness and sharpness of feature, or atleast what might have seemed such in a European estimateof beauty.The manners of the Eastern warrior were grave, graceful,and decorous; indicating, however, in some particulars, thehabitual restraint which men of warm and choleric tempersoften set as a guard upon their native impetuosity of disposi-tion, and at the same time a sense of his own dignity, whichseemed to impose a certain formality of behaviour in himwho entertained it.This haughty feeling of superiority was perhaps equallyentertained by his new European acquaintance, but the ef-fect was different; and the same feeling, which dictated tothe Christian knight a bold, blunt, and somewhat carelessbearing, as one too conscious of his own importance to be 29Sir Walter Scottanxious about the opinions of others, appeared to prescribeto the Saracen a style of courtesy more studiously and for-mally observant of ceremony. Both were courteous; but thecourtesy of the Christian seemed to flow rather from a goodhumoured sense of what was due to others; that of the Mos-lem, from a high feeling of what was to be expected fromhimself.The provision which each had made for his refreshmentwas simple, but the meal of the Saracen was abstemious. Ahandful of dates and a morsel of coarse barley-bread sufficedto relieve the hunger of the latter, whose education had ha-bituated them to the fare of the desert, although, since theirSyrian conquests, the Arabian simplicity of life frequentlygave place to the most unbounded profusion of luxury. Afew draughts from the lovely fountain by which they reposedcompleted his meal. That of the Christian, though coarse,was more genial. Dried hog?s flesh, the abomination of theMoslemah, was the chief part of his repast; and his drink,derived from a leathern bottle, contained something betterthan pure element. He fed with more display of appetite,and drank with more appearance of satisfaction, than theSaracen judged it becoming to show in the performance of amere bodily function; and, doubtless, the secret contemptwhich each entertained for the other, as the follower of afalse religion, was considerably increased by the marked dif-ference of their diet and manners. But each had found theweight of his opponent?s arm, and the mutual respect whichthe bold struggle had created was sufficient to subdue otherand inferior considerations. Yet the Saracen could not helpremarking the circumstances which displeased him in theChristian?s conduct and manners; and, after he had witnessedfor some time in silence the keen appetite which protractedthe knight?s banquet long after his own was concluded, hethus addressed him:??Valiant Nazarene, is it fitting that one who can fight likea man should feed like a dog or a wolf? Even a misbelievingJew would shudder at the food which you seem to eat withas much relish as if it were fruit from the trees of Paradise.??Valiant Saracen,? answered the Christian, looking up withsome surprise at the accusation thus unexpectedly brought,?know thou that I exercise my Christian freedom in usingthat which is forbidden to the Jews, being, as they esteem 30The Talismanthemselves, under the bondage of the old law of Moses. We,Saracen, be it known to thee, have a better warrant for whatwe do?Ave Maria!?be we thankful.? And, as if in defianceof his companion?s scruples, he concluded a short Latin gracewith a long draught from the leathern bottle.?That, too, you call a part of your liberty,? said the Saracen;?and as you feed like the brutes, so you degrade yourself tothe bestial condition by drinking a poisonous liquor whicheven they refuse!??Know, foolish Saracen,? replied the Christian, withouthesitation, ?that thou blasphemest the gifts of God, even withthe blasphemy of thy father Ishmael. The juice of the grapeis given to him that will use it wisely, as that which cheersthe heart of man after toil, refreshes him in sickness, andcomforts him in sorrow. He who so enjoyeth it may thankGod for his wine-cup as for his daily bread; and he whoabuseth the gift of Heaven is not a greater fool in his intoxi-cation than thou in thine abstinence.?The keen eye of the Saracen kindled at this sarcasm, andhis hand sought the hilt of his poniard. It was but a momen-tary thought, however, and died away in the recollection ofthe powerful champion with whom he had to deal, and thedesperate grapple, the impression of which still throbbed inhis limbs and veins; and he contented himself with pursuingthe contest in colloquy, as more convenient for the time.?Thy words? he said, ?O Nazarene, might create anger,did not thy ignorance raise compassion. Seest thou not, Othou more blind than any who asks alms at the door of theMosque, that the liberty thou dost boast of is restrained evenin that which is dearest to man?s happiness and to his house-hold; and that thy law, if thou dost practise it, binds thee inmarriage to one single mate, be she sick or healthy, be shefruitful or barren, bring she comfort and joy, or clamour andstrife, to thy table and to thy bed? This, Nazarene, I do in-deed call slavery; whereas, to the faithful, hath the Prophetassigned upon earth the patriarchal privileges of Abrahamour father, and of Solomon, the wisest of mankind, havinggiven us here a succession of beauty at our pleasure, andbeyond the grave the black-eyed houris of Paradise.??Now, by His name that I most reverence in heaven,? saidthe Christian, ?and by hers whom I most worship on earth,thou art but a blinded and a bewildered infidel!? That dia- 31Sir Walter Scottmond signet which thou wearest on thy finger, thou holdestit, doubtless, as of inestimable value???Balsora and Bagdad cannot show the like,? replied theSaracen; ?but what avails it to our purpose???Much,? replied the Frank,? as thou shalt thyself confess.Take my war-axe and dash the stone into twenty shivers:would each fragment be as valuable as the original gem, orwould they, all collected, bear the tenth part of its estima-tion???That is a child?s question,? answered the Saracen; ?thefragments of such a stone would not equal the entire jewel inthe degree of hundreds to one.??Saracen,? replied the Christian warrior, ?the love which atrue knight binds on one only, fair and faithful, is the gementire; the affection thou flingest among thy enslaved wivesand half-wedded slaves is worthless, comparatively, as thesparkling shivers of the broken diamond.??Now, by the Holy Caaba,? said the Emir, ?thou art a mad-man who hugs his chain of iron as if it were of gold! Lookmore closely. This ring of mine would lose half its beautywere not the signet encircled and enchased with these lesserbrilliants, which grace it and set it off. The central diamondis man, firm and entire, his value depending on himself alone;and this circle of lesser jewels are women, borrowing his lus-tre, which he deals out to them as best suits his pleasure orhis convenience. Take the central stone from the signet, andthe diamond itself remains as valuable as ever, while the lessergems are comparatively of little value. And this is the truereading of thy parable; for what sayeth the poet Mansour: ?Itis the favour of man which giveth beauty and comeliness towoman, as the stream glitters no longer when the sun ceasethto shine.???Saracen,? replied the Crusader, ?thou speakest like onewho never saw a woman worthy the affection of a soldier.Believe me, couldst thou look upon those of Europe, towhom, after Heaven, we of the order of knighthood vowfealty and devotion, thou wouldst loathe for ever the poorsensual slaves who form thy haram. The beauty of our fairones gives point to our spears and edge to our swords; theirwords are our law; and as soon will a lamp shed lustre whenunkindled, as a knight distinguish himself by feats of arms,having no mistress of his affection.? 32The Talisman?I have heard of this frenzy among the warriors of the West,?said the Emir, ?and have ever accounted it one of the accom-panying symptoms of that insanity which brings you hitherto obtain possession of an empty sepulchre. But yet, methinks,so highly have the Franks whom I have met with extolledthe beauty of their women, I could be well contented to be-hold with mine own eyes those charms which can transformsuch brave warriors into the tools of their pleasure.??Brave Saracen,? said the Knight, ?if I were not on a pil-grimage to the Holy Sepulchre, it should be my pride toconduct you, on assurance of safety, to the camp of Richardof England, than whom none knows better how to do honourto a noble foe; and though I be poor and unattended yethave I interest to secure for thee, or any such as thou seemest,not safety only, but respect and esteem. There shouldst thousee several of the fairest beauties of France and Britain forma small circle, the brilliancy of which exceeds ten-thousand-fold the lustre of mines of diamonds such as thine.??Now, by the corner-stone of the Caaba!? said the Saracen,?I will accept thy invitation as freely as it is given, if thouwilt postpone thy present intent; and, credit me, braveNazarene, it were better for thyself to turn back thy horse?shead towards the camp of thy people, for to travel towardsJerusalem without a passport is but a wilful casting-away ofthy life.??I have a pass,? answered the Knight, producing a parch-ment, ?Under Saladin?s hand and signet.?The Saracen bent his head to the dust as he recognized theseal and handwriting of the renowned Soldan of Egypt andSyria; and having kissed the paper with profound respect, hepressed it to his forehead, then returned it to the Christian,saying, ?Rash Frank, thou hast sinned against thine ownblood and mine, for not showing this to me when we met.??You came with levelled spear,? said the Knight. ?Had atroop of Saracens so assailed me, it might have stood withmy honour to have shown the Soldan?s pass, but never toone man.??And yet one man,? said the Saracen haughtily, ?was enoughto interrupt your journey.??True, brave Moslem,? replied the Christian; ?but thereare few such as thou art. Such falcons fly not in flocks; or, ifthey do, they pounce not in numbers upon one.? 33Sir Walter Scott?Thou dost us but justice,? said the Saracen, evidently grati-fied by the compliment, as he had been touched by the im-plied scorn of the European?s previous boast; ?from us thoushouldst have had no wrong. But well was it for me that Ifailed to slay thee, with the safeguard of the king of kingsupon thy person. Certain it were, that the cord or the sabrehad justly avenged such guilt.??I am glad to hear that its influence shall be availing tome,? said the Knight; ?for I have heard that the road is in-fested with robber-tribes, who regard nothing in compari-son of an opportunity of plunder.?The truth has been told to thee, brave Christian,? saidthe Saracen; ?but I swear to thee, by the turban of the Prophet,that shouldst thou miscarry in any haunt of such villains, Iwill myself undertake thy revenge with five thousand horse.I will slay every male of them, and send their women intosuch distant captivity that the name of their tribe shall neveragain be heard within five hundred miles of Damascus. Iwill sow with salt the foundations of their village, and thereshall never live thing dwell there, even from that time for-ward.??I had rather the trouble which you design for yourselfwere in revenge of some other more important person thanof me, noble Emir,? replied the Knight; ?but my vow is re-corded in heaven, for good or for evil, and I must be in-debted to you for pointing me out the way to my resting-place for this evening.??That,? said the Saracen, ?must be under the black cover-ing of my father?s tent.??This night,? answered the Christian, ?I must pass in prayerand penitence with a holy man, Theodorick of Engaddi, whodwells amongst these wilds, and spends his life in the serviceof God.??I will at least see you safe thither,? said the Saracen.?That would be pleasant convoy for me,? said the Chris-tian; ?yet might endanger the future security of the goodfather; for the cruel hand of your people has been red withthe blood of the servants of the Lord, and therefore do wecome hither in plate and mail, with sword and lance, to openthe road to the Holy Sepulchre, and protect the chosen saintsand anchorites who yet dwell in this land of promise and ofmiracle.? 34The Talisman?Nazarene,? said the Moslem, ?in this the Greeks and Syr-ians have much belied us, seeing we do but after the word ofAbubeker Alwakel, the successor of the Prophet, and, afterhim, the first commander of true believers. ?Go forth,? hesaid, ?Yezed Ben Sophian,? when he sent that renowned gen-eral to take Syria from the infidels; ?quit yourselves like menin battle, but slay neither the aged, the infirm, the women,nor the children. Waste not the land, neither destroy cornand fruit-trees; they are the gifts of Allah. Keep faith whenyou have made any covenant, even if it be to your own harm.If ye find holy men labouring with their hands, and servingGod in the desert, hurt them not, neither destroy their dwell-ings. But when you find them with shaven crowns, they areof the synagogue of Satan! Smite with the sabre, slay, ceasenot till they become believers or tributaries.? As the Caliph,companion of the Prophet, hath told us, so have we done,and those whom our justice has smitten are but the priests ofSatan. But unto the good men who, without stirring up na-tion against nation, worship sincerely in the faith of Issa BenMariam, we are a shadow and a shield; and such being hewhom you seek, even though the light of the Prophet hathnot reached him, from me he will only have love, favour,and regard.??The anchorite whom I would now visit,? said the warlikepilgrim, ?is, I have heard, no priest; but were he of thatanointed and sacred order, I would prove with my good lance,against paynim and infidel???Let us not defy each other, brother,? interrupted theSaracen; ?we shall find, either of us, enough of Franks or ofMoslemah on whom to exercise both sword and lance. ThisTheodorick is protected both by Turk and Arab; and, thoughone of strange conditions at intervals, yet, on the whole, hebears himself so well as the follower of his own prophet, thathe merits the protection of him who was sent???Now, by Our Lady, Saracen,? exclaimed the Christian,?if thou darest name in the same breath the camel-driver ofMecca with??An electrical shock of passion thrilled through the form ofthe Emir; but it was only momentary, and the calmness ofhis reply had both dignity and reason in it, when he said,?Slander not him whom thou knowest not?the rather thatwe venerate the founder of thy religion, while we condemn 35Sir Walter Scottthe doctrine which your priests have spun from it. I willmyself guide thee to the cavern of the hermit, which,methinks, without my help, thou wouldst find it a hard matterto reach. And, on the way, let us leave to mollahs and tomonks to dispute about the divinity of our faith, and speakon themes which belong to youthful warriors?upon battles,upon beautiful women, upon sharp swords, and upon brightarmour.?CHAPTER III.THE WARRIORS arose from their place of brief rest and simplerefreshment, and courteously aided each other while theycarefully replaced and adjusted the harness from which theyhad relieved for the time their trusty steeds. Each seemedfamiliar with an employment which at that time was a partof necessary and, indeed, of indispensable duty. Each alsoseemed to possess, as far as the difference betwixt the animaland rational species admitted, the confidence and affectionof the horse which was the constant companion of his trav-els and his warfare. With the Saracen this familiar intimacywas a part of his early habits; for, in the tents of the Easternmilitary tribes, the horse of the soldier ranks next to, andalmost equal in importance with, his wife and his family;and with the European warrior, circumstances, and indeednecessity, rendered his war-horse scarcely less than his brotherin arms. The steeds, therefore, suffered themselves quietly tobe taken from their food and liberty, and neighed and snuffledfondly around their masters, while they were adjusting theiraccoutrements for further travel and additional toil. And each 36The Talismanwarrior, as he prosecuted his own task, or assisted with cour-tesy his companion, looked with observant curiosity at theequipments of his fellow-traveller, and noted particularly whatstruck him as peculiar in the fashion in which he arrangedhis riding accoutrements.Ere they remounted to resume their journey, the ChristianKnight again moistened his lips and dipped his hands in theliving fountain, and said to his pagan associate of the jour-ney, ?I would I knew the name of this delicious fountain,that I might hold it in my grateful remembrance; for neverdid water slake more deliciously a more oppressive thirst thanI have this day experienced.??It is called in the Arabic language,? answered the Saracen,?by a name which signifies the Diamond of the Desert.??And well is it so named,? replied the Christian. ?My na-tive valley hath a thousand springs, but not to one of themshall I attach hereafter such precious recollection as to thissolitary fount, which bestows its liquid treasures where theyare not only delightful, but nearly indispensable.??You say truth,? said the Saracen; ?for the curse is still onyonder sea of death, and neither man nor beast drinks of itswaves, nor of the river which feeds without filling it, untilthis inhospitable desert be passed.?They mounted, and pursued their journey across the sandywaste. The ardour of noon was now past, and a light breezesomewhat alleviated the terrors of the desert, though notwithout bearing on its wings an impalpable dust, which theSaracen little heeded, though his heavily-armed companionfelt it as such an annoyance that he hung his iron casque athis saddle-bow, and substituted the light riding-cap, termedin the language of the time a mortier, from its resemblance inshape to an ordinary mortar. They rode together for sometime in silence, the Saracen performing the part of directorand guide of the journey, which he did by observing minutemarks and bearings of the distant rocks, to a ridge of whichthey were gradually approaching. For a little time he seemedabsorbed in the task, as a pilot when navigating a vesselthrough a difficult channel; but they had not proceeded halfa league when he seemed secure of his route, and disposed,with more frankness than was usual to his nation, to enterinto conversation.?You have asked the name,? he said, ?of a mute fountain, 37Sir Walter Scottwhich hath the semblance, but not the reality, of a livingthing. Let me be pardoned to ask the name of the compan-ion with whom I have this day encountered, both in dangerand in repose, and which I cannot fancy unknown even hereamong the deserts of Palestine???It is not yet worth publishing,? said the Christian. ?Know,however, that among the soldiers of the Cross I am calledKenneth?Kenneth of the Couching Leopard; at home Ihave other titles, but they would sound harsh in an Easternear. Brave Saracen, let me ask which of the tribes of Arabiaclaims your descent, and by what name you are known???Sir Kenneth,? said the Moslem, ?I joy that your name issuch as my lips can easily utter. For me, I am no Arab, yetderive my descent from a line neither less wild nor less war-like. Know, Sir Knight of the Leopard, that I am Sheerkohf,the Lion of the Mountain, and that Kurdistan, from which Iderive my descent, holds no family more noble than that ofSeljook.??I have heard,? answered the Christian, ?that your greatSoldan claims his blood from the same source???Thanks to the Prophet that hath so far honoured ourmountains as to send from their bosom him whose word isvictory,? answered the paynim. ?I am but as a worm beforethe King of Egypt and Syria, and yet in my own land some-thing my name may avail. Stranger, with how many mendidst thou come on this warfare???By my faith,? said Sir Kenneth, ?with aid of friends andkinsmen, I was hardly pinched to furnish forth ten well-ap-pointed lances, with maybe some fifty more men, archersand varlets included. Some have deserted my unlucky pen-non?some have fallen in battle?several have died of dis-ease?and one trusty armour-bearer, for whose life I am nowdoing my pilgrimage, lies on the bed of sickness.??Christian,? said Sheerkohf, ?here I have five arrows in myquiver, each feathered from the wing of an eagle. When Isend one of them to my tents, a thousand warriors mounton horseback?when I send another, an equal force willarise?for the five, I can command five thousand men; andif I send my bow, ten thousand mounted riders will shakethe desert. And with thy fifty followers thou hast come toinvade a land in which I am one of the meanest!??Now, by the rood, Saracen,? retorted the Western war- 38The Talismanrior, ?thou shouldst know, ere thou vauntest thyself, that onesteel glove can crush a whole handful of hornets.??Ay, but it must first enclose them within its grasp,? saidthe Saracen, with a smile which might have endangered theirnew alliance, had he not changed the subject by adding, ?Andis bravery so much esteemed amongst the Christian princesthat thou, thus void of means and of men, canst offer, asthou didst of late, to be my protector and security in thecamp of thy brethren???Know, Saracen,? said the Christian, ?since such is thy style,that the name of a knight, and the blood of a gentleman,entitle him to place himself on the same rank with sover-eigns even of the first degree, in so far as regards all but regalauthority and dominion. Were Richard of England himselfto wound the honour of a knight as poor as I am, he couldnot, by the law of chivalry, deny him the combat.??Methinks I should like to look upon so strange a scene,?said the Emir, ?in which a leathern belt and a pair of spursput the poorest on a level with the most powerful.??You must add free blood and a fearless heart,? said theChristian; ?then, perhaps, you will not have spoken untrulyof the dignity of knighthood.??And mix you as boldly amongst the females of your chiefsand leaders?? asked the Saracen.?God forbid,? said the Knight of the Leopard, ?that thepoorest knight in Christendom should not be free, in allhonourable service, to devote his hand and sword, the fameof his actions, and the fixed devotion of his heart, to thefairest princess who ever wore coronet on her brow!??But a little while since,? said the Saracen, ?and you de-scribed love as the highest treasure of the heart?thine hathundoubtedly been high and nobly bestowed???Stranger,? answered the Christian, blushing deeply as hespoke, ?we tell not rashly where it is we have bestowed ourchoicest treasures. It is enough for thee to know that, as thousayest, my love is highly and nobly bestowed?most highly?most nobly; but if thou wouldst hear of love and brokenlances, venture thyself, as thou sayest, to the camp of theCrusaders, and thou wilt find exercise for thine ears, and, ifthou wilt, for thy hands too.?The Eastern warrior, raising himself in his stirrups, andshaking aloft his lance, replied, ? Hardly, I fear, shall I find 39Sir Walter Scottone with a crossed shoulder who will exchange with me thecast of the jerrid.??I will not promise for that,? replied the Knight; ?thoughthere be in the camp certain Spaniards, who have right goodskill in your Eastern game of hurling the javelin.??Dogs, and sons of dogs!? ejaculated the Saracen; ?whathave these Spaniards to do to come hither to combat thetrue believers, who, in their own land, are their lords andtaskmasters? with them I would mix in no warlike pastime.??Let not the knights of Leon or Asturias hear you speakthus of them,? said the Knight of the Leopard. ? But,? addedhe, smiling at the recollection of the morning?s combat, ?if,instead of a reed, you were inclined to stand the cast of abattle-axe, there are enough of Western warriors who wouldgratify your longing.??By the beard of my father, sir,? said the Saracen, with anapproach to laughter, ?the game is too rough for mere sport.I will never shun them in battle, but my head? (pressing hishand to his brow) ?will not, for a while, permit me to seekthem in sport.??I would you saw the axe of King Richard,? answered theWestern warrior, ?to which that which hangs at my saddle-bow weighs but as a feather.??We hear much of that island sovereign,? said the Saracen.?Art thou one of his subjects???One of his followers I am, for this expedition,? answeredthe Knight, ?and honoured in the service; but not born hissubject, although a native of the island in which he reigns.??How mean you? ? said the Eastern soldier; ?have you thentwo kings in one poor island???As thou sayest,? said the Scot, for such was Sir Kennethby birth. ?It is even so; and yet, although the inhabitants ofthe two extremities of that island are engaged in frequentwar, the country can, as thou seest, furnish forth such a bodyof men-at-arms as may go far to shake the unholy hold whichyour master hath laid on the cities of Zion.??By the beard of Saladin, Nazarene, but that it is a thought-less and boyish folly, I could laugh at the simplicity of yourgreat Sultan, who comes hither to make conquests of desertsand rocks, and dispute the possession of them with thosewho have tenfold numbers at command, while he leaves apart of his narrow islet, in which he was born a sovereign, to 40The Talismanthe dominion of another sceptre than his. Surely, Sir Ken-neth, you and the other good men of your country shouldhave submitted yourselves to the dominion of this King Ri-chard ere you left your native land, divided against itself, toset forth on this expedition??Hasty and fierce was Kenneth?s answer. ?No, by the brightlight of Heaven! If the King of England had not set forth tothe Crusade till he was sovereign of Scotland, the Crescentmight, for me, and all true-hearted Scots, glimmer for everon the walls of Zion.?Thus far he had proceeded, when, suddenly recollectinghimself, he muttered, ?Mea culpa! Mea culpa! what have I, asoldier of the Cross, to do with recollection of war betwixtChristian nations!?The rapid expression of feeling corrected by the dictates ofduty did not escape the Moslem, who, if he did not entirelyunderstand all which it conveyed, saw enough to convincehim with the assurance that Christians, as well as Moslemah,had private feelings of personal pique, and national quarrels,which were not entirely reconcilable. But the Saracens werea race, polished, perhaps, to the utmost extent which theirreligion permitted, and particularly capable of entertaininghigh ideas of courtesy and politeness; and such sentimentsprevented his taking any notice of the inconsistency of SirKenneth?s feelings in the opposite characters of a Scot and aCrusader.Meanwhile, as they advanced, the scene began to changearound them. They were now turning to the eastward, andhad reached the range of steep and barren hills which bindsin that quarter the naked plain, and varies the surface of thecountry, without changing its sterile character. Sharp, rockyeminences began to rise around them, and, in a short time,deep declivities and ascents, both formidable in height anddifficult from the narrowness of the path, offered to the trav-ellers obstacles of a different kind from those with whichthey had recently contended.Dark caverns and chasms amongst the rocks?those grot-toes so often alluded to in Scripture?yawned fearfully oneither side as they proceeded, and the Scottish knight wasinformed by the Emir that these were often the refuge ofbeasts of prey, or of men still more ferocious, who, driven todesperation by the constant war, and the oppression exer- 41Sir Walter Scottcised by the soldiery, as well of the Cross as of the Crescent,had become robbers, and spared neither rank nor religion,neither sex nor age, in their depredations.The Scottish knight listened with indifference to the ac-counts of ravages committed by wild beasts or wicked men,secure as he felt himself in his own valour and personalstrength; but he was struck with mysterious dread when herecollected that he was now in the awful wilderness of theforty days? fast, and the scene of the actual personal tempta-tion, wherewith the Evil Principle was permitted to assailthe Son of Man. He withdrew his attention gradually fromthe light and worldly conversation of the infidel warrior be-side him, and, however acceptable his gay and gallant brav-ery would have rendered him as a companion elsewhere, SirKenneth felt as if, in those wildernesses the waste and dryplaces in which the foul spirits were wont to wander whenexpelled the mortals whose forms they possessed, a bare-footed friar would have been a better associate than the gaybut unbelieving paynim.These feelings embarrassed him the rather that the Saracen?sspirits appeared to rise with the journey, and because thefarther he penetrated into the gloomy recesses of the moun-tains, the lighter became his conversation, and when he foundthat unanswered, the louder grew his song. Sir Kenneth knewenough of the Eastern languages to be assured that he chantedsonnets of love, containing all the glowing praises of beautyin which the Oriental poets are so fond of luxuriating, andwhich, therefore, were peculiarly unfitted for a serious ordevotional strain of thought, the feeling best becoming theWilderness of the Temptation. With inconsistency enough,the Saracen also sung lays in praise of wine, the liquid rubyof the Persian poets; and his gaiety at length became so un-suitable to the Christian knight?s contrary train of sentiments,as, but for the promise of amity which they had exchanged,would most likely have made Sir Kenneth take measures tochange his note. As it was, the Crusader felt as if he had byhis side some gay, licentious fiend, who endeavoured to en-snare his soul, and endanger his immortal salvation, by in-spiring loose thoughts of earthly pleasure, and thus pollut-ing his devotion, at a time when his faith as a Christian andhis vow as a pilgrim called on him for a serious and peniten-tial state of mind. We was thus greatly perplexed, and unde- 42The Talismancided how to act; and it was in a tone of hasty displeasurethat, at length breaking silence, he interrupted the lay of thecelebrated Rudpiki, in which he prefers the mole on hismistress?s bosom to all the wealth of Bokhara and Samarcand.?Saracen,? said the Crusader sternly, ?blinded as thou art,and plunged amidst the errors of a false law, thou shouldstyet comprehend that there are some places more holy thanothers, and that there are some scenes also in which the EvilOne hath more than ordinary power over sinful mortals. Iwill not tell thee for what awful reason this place?theserocks?these caverns with their gloomy arches, leading as itwere to the central abyss?are held an especial haunt of Sa-tan and his angels. It is enough that I have been long warnedto beware of this place by wise and holy men, to whom thequalities of the unholy region are well known. Wherefore,Saracen, forbear thy foolish and ill-timed levity, and turnthy thoughts to things more suited to the spot ?although,alas for thee! thy best prayers are but as blasphemy and sin.?The Saracen listened with some surprise, and then replied,with good-humour and gaiety, only so far repressed as cour-tesy required, ?Good Sir Kenneth, methinks you deal un-equally by your companion, or else ceremony is but indiffer-ently taught amongst your Western tribes. I took no offencewhen I saw you gorge hog?s flesh and drink wine, and per-mitted you to enjoy a treat which you called your Christianliberty, only pitying in my heart your foul pastimes. Where-fore, then, shouldst thou take scandal, because I cheer, tothe best of my power, a gloomy road with a cheerful verse?What saith the poet, ?Song is like the dews of heaven on thebosom of the desert; it cools the path of the traveller.???Friend Saracen,? said the Christian, ?I blame not the loveof minstrelsy and of the gai science; albeit, we yield unto iteven too much room in our thoughts when they should bebent on better things. But prayers and holy psalms are betterfitting than lais of love, or of wine-cups, when men walk inthis Valley of the Shadow of Death, full of fiends and de-mons, whom the prayers of holy men have driven forth fromthe haunts of humanity to wander amidst scenes as accursedas themselves.??Speak not thus of the Genii, Christian,? answered theSaracen, ?for know thou speakest to one whose line and na-tion drew their origin from the immortal race which your 43Sir Walter Scottsect fear and blaspheme.??I well thought,? answered the Crusader, ?that your blindedrace had their descent from the foul fiend, without whoseaid you would never have been able to maintain this blessedland of Palestine against so many valiant soldiers of God. Ispeak not thus of thee in particular, Saracen, but generally ofthy people and religion. Strange is it to me, however, notthat you should have the descent from the Evil One, butthat you should boast of it.??From whom should the bravest boast of descending, sav-ing from him that is bravest?? said the Saracen; ?from whomshould the proudest trace their line so well as from the DarkSpirit, which would rather fall headlong by force than bendthe knee by his will? Eblis may be hated, stranger, but hemust be feared; and such as Eblis are his descendants ofKurdistan.?Tales of magic and of necromancy were the learning of theperiod, and Sir Kenneth heard his companion?s confessionof diabolical descent without any disbelief, and without muchwonder; yet not without a secret shudder at finding himselfin this fearful place, in the company of one who avouchedhimself to belong to such a lineage. Naturally insusceptible,however, of fear, he crossed himself, and stoutly demandedof the Saracen an account of the pedigree which he hadboasted. The latter readily complied.?Know, brave stranger,? he said, ?that when the cruelZohauk, one of the descendants of Giamschid, held thethrone of Persia, he formed a league with the Powers of Dark-ness, amidst the secret vaults of Istakhar, vaults which thehands of the elementary spirits had hewn out of the livingrock long before Adam himself had an existence. Here hefed, with daily oblations of human blood, two devouringserpents, which had become, according to the poets, a partof himself, and to sustain whom he levied a tax of daily hu-man sacrifices, till the exhausted patience of his subjectscaused some to raise up the scimitar of resistance, like thevaliant Blacksmith and the victorious Feridoun, by whomthe tyrant was at length dethroned, and imprisoned for everin the dismal caverns of the mountain Damavend. But erethat deliverance had taken place, and whilst the power of thebloodthirsty tyrant was at its height, the band of raveningslaves whom he had sent forth to purvey victims for his daily 44The Talismansacrifice brought to the vaults of the palace of Istakhar sevensisters so beautiful that they seemed seven houris. These sevenmaidens were the daughters of a sage, who had no treasuressave those beauties and his own wisdom. The last was notsufficient to foresee this misfortune, the former seemed inef-fectual to prevent it. The eldest exceeded not her twentiethyear, the youngest had scarce attained her thirteenth; and solike were they to each other that they could not have beendistinguished but for the difference of height, in which theygradually rose in easy gradation above each other, like theascent which leads to the gates of Paradise. So lovely werethese seven sisters when they stood in the darksome vault,disrobed of all clothing saving a cymar of white silk, thattheir charms moved the hearts of those who were not mor-tal. Thunder muttered, the earth shook, the wall of the vaultwas rent, and at the chasm entered one dressed like a hunter,with bow and shafts, and followed by six others, his breth-ren. They were tall men, and, though dark, yet comely tobehold; but their eyes had more the glare of those of thedead than the light which lives under the eyelids of the liv-ing. ?Zeineb,? said the leader of the band?and as he spokehe took the eldest sister by the hand, and his voice was soft,low, and melancholy??I am Cothrob, king of the subterra-nean world, and supreme chief of Ginnistan. I and my breth-ren are of those who, created out of the pure elementary fire,disdained, even at the command of Omnipotence, to do hom-age to a clod of earth, because it was called Man. Thou mayesthave heard of us as cruel, unrelenting, and persecuting. It isfalse. We are by nature kind and generous; only vengefulwhen insulted, only cruel when affronted. We are true tothose who trust us; and we have heard the invocations of thyfather, the sage Mithrasp, who wisely worships not alone theOrigin of Good, but that which is called the Source of Evil.You and your sisters are on the eve of death; but let each giveto us one hair from your fair tresses, in token of fealty, andwe will carry you many miles from hence to a place of safety,where you may bid defiance to Zohauk and his ministers.?The fear of instant death, saith the poet, is like the rod of theprophet Haroun, which devoured all other rods when trans-formed into snakes before the King of Pharaoh; and thedaughters of the Persian sage were less apt than others to beafraid of the addresses of a spirit. They gave the tribute which 45Sir Walter ScottCothrob demanded, and in an instant the sisters were trans-ported to an enchanted castle on the mountains of Tugrut,in Kurdistan, and were never again seen by mortal eye. Butin process of time seven youths, distinguished in the warand in the chase, appeared in the environs of the castle of thedemons. They were darker, taller, fiercer, and more resolutethan any of the scattered inhabitants of the valleys ofKurdistan; and they took to themselves wives, and becamefathers of the seven tribes of the Kurdmans, whose valour isknown throughout the universe.?The Christian knight heard with wonder the wild tale, ofwhich Kurdistan still possesses the traces, and, after amoment?s thought, replied, ?Verily, Sir Knight, you havespoken well?your genealogy may be dreaded and hated,but it cannot be contemned. Neither do I any longer won-der at your obstinacy in a false faith, since, doubtless, it ispart of the fiendish disposition which hath descended fromyour ancestors, those infernal huntsmen, as you have de-scribed them, to love falsehood rather than truth; and I nolonger marvel that your spirits become high and exalted, andvent themselves in verse and in tunes, when you approach tothe places encumbered by the haunting of evil spirits, whichmust excite in you that joyous feeling which others experi-ence when approaching the land of their human ancestry.??By my father?s beard, I think thou hast the right,? said theSaracen, rather amused than offended by the freedom withwhich the Christian had uttered his reflections; ?for, thoughthe Prophet (blessed be his name!) hath sown amongst us theseed of a better faith than our ancestors learned in the ghostlyhalls of Tugrut, yet we are not willing, like other Moslemah,to pass hasty doom on the lofty and powerful elementary spir-its from whom we claim our origin. These Genii, according toour belief and hope, are not altogether reprobate, but are stillin the way of probation, and may hereafter be punished orrewarded. Leave we this to the mollahs and the imaums.Enough that with us the reverence for these spirits is not alto-gether effaced by what we have learned from the Koran, andthat many of us still sing, in memorial of our fathers? moreancient faith, such verses as these.?So saying, he proceeded to chant verses, very ancient in thelanguage and structure, which some have thought derive theirsource from the worshippers of Arimanes, the Evil Principle. 46The TalismanAHRIMAN.Dark Ahriman, whom Irak stillHolds origin of woe and ill!When, bending at thy shrine,We view the world with troubled eye,Where see we ?neath the extended sky,An empire matching thine!If the Benigner Power can yieldA fountain in the desert field,Where weary pilgrims drink;Thine are the waves that lash the rock,Thine the tornado?s deadly shock,Where countless navies sink!Or if he bid the soil dispenseBalsams to cheer the sinking sense,How few can they deliverFrom lingering pains, or pang intense,Red Fever, spotted Pestilence,The arrows of thy quiver!Chief in Man?s bosom sits thy sway,And frequent, while in words we prayBefore another throne,Whate?er of specious form be there,The secret meaning of the prayerIs, Ahriman, thine own.Say, hast thou feeling, sense, and form,Thunder thy voice, thy garments storm,As Eastern Magi say;With sentient soul of hate and wrath,And wings to sweep thy deadly path,And fangs to tear thy prey?Or art thou mix?d in Nature?s source,An ever-operating force,Converting good to ill;An evil principle innate,Contending with our better fate,And, oh! victorious still? 47Sir Walter ScottHowe?er it be, dispute is vain.On all without thou hold?st thy reign,Nor less on all within;Each mortal passion?s fierce career,Love, hate, ambition, joy, and fear,Thou goadest into sin.Whene?er a sunny gleam appears,To brighten up our vale of tears,Thou art not distant far;?Mid such brief solace of our lives,Thou whett?st our very banquet-knivesTo tools of death and war.Thus, from the moment of our birth,Long as we linger on the earth,Thou rulest the fate of men;Thine are the pangs of life?s last hour,And?who dare answer??is thy power,Dark Spirit! ended then?[The worthy and learned clergyman by whom this species ofhymn has been translated desires, that, for fear of miscon-ception, we should warn the reader to recollect that it is com-posed by a heathen, to whom the real causes of moral andphysical evil are unknown, and who views their predomi-nance in the system of the universe as all must view thatappalling fact who have not the benefit of the Christian rev-elation. On our own part, we beg to add, that we under-stand the style of the translator is more paraphrastic thancan be approved by those who are acquainted with the sin-gularly curious original. The translator seems to have de-spaired of rendering into English verse the flights of Orien-tal poetry; and, possibly, like many learned and ingeniousmen, finding it impossible to discover the sense of the origi-nal, he may have tacitly substituted his own.]THESE VERSES MAY perhaps have been the not unnatural effu-sion of some half-enlightened philosopher, who, in the fableddeity, Arimanes, saw but the prevalence of moral and physi-cal evil; but in the ears of Sir Kenneth of the Leopard theyhad a different effect, and, sung as they were by one whohad just boasted himself a descendant of demons, soundedvery like an address of worship to the arch-fiend himself. Heweighed within himself whether, on hearing such blasphemyin the very desert where Satan had stood rebuked for de- 48The Talismanmanding homage, taking an abrupt leave of the Saracen wassufficient to testify his abhorrence; or whether he was notrather constrained by his vow as a Crusader to defy the infi-del to combat on the spot, and leave him food for the beastsof the wilderness, when his attention was suddenly caughtby an unexpected apparition.The light was now verging low, yet served the knight stillto discern that they two were no longer alone in the desert,but were closely watched by a figure of great height and verythin, which skipped over rocks and bushes with so muchagility as, added to the wild and hirsute appearance of theindividual, reminded him of the fauns and silvans, whoseimages he had seen in the ancient temples of Rome. As thesingle-hearted Scottishman had never for a moment doubtedthese gods of the ancient Gentiles to be actually devils, so henow hesitated not to believe that the blasphemous hymn ofthe Saracen had raised up an infernal spirit.?But what recks it?? said stout Sir Kenneth to himself;?down with the fiend and his worshippers!?He did not, however, think it necessary to give the samewarning of defiance to two enemies as he would unques-tionably have afforded to one. His hand was upon his mace,and perhaps the unwary Saracen would have been paid forhis Persian poetry by having his brains dashed out on thespot, without any reason assigned for it; but the ScottishKnight was spared from committing what would have beena sore blot in his shield of arms. The apparition, on whichhis eyes had been fixed for some time, had at first appearedto dog their path by concealing itself behind rocks and shrubs,using those advantages of the ground with great address, andsurmounting its irregularities with surprising agility. Atlength, just as the Saracen paused in his song, the figure,which was that of a tall man clothed in goat-skins, sprunginto the midst of the path, and seized a rein of the Saracen?sbridle in either hand, confronting thus and bearing back thenoble horse, which, unable to endure the manner in whichthis sudden assailant pressed the long-armed bit, and thesevere curb, which, according to the Eastern fashion, was asolid ring of iron, reared upright, and finally fell backwardson his master, who, however, avoided the peril of the fall bylightly throwing himself to one side.The assailant then shifted his grasp from the bridle of the 49Sir Walter Scotthorse to the throat of the rider, flung himself above the strug-gling Saracen, and, despite of his youth and activity kepthim undermost, wreathing his long arms above those of hisprisoner, who called out angrily, and yet half-laughing at thesame time ??Hamako?fool?unloose me?this passes thyprivilege?unloose me, or I will use my dagger.??Thy dagger!?infidel dog!? said the figure in the goat-skins, ?hold it in thy gripe if thou canst!? and in an instanthe wrenched the Saracen?s weapon out of its owner?s hand,and brandished it over his head.?Help, Nazarene!? cried Sheerkohf, now seriously alarmed;?help, or the Hamako will slay me.??Slay thee!? replied the dweller of the desert; ?and wellhast thou merited death, for singing thy blasphemous hymns,not only to the praise of thy false prophet, who is the foulfiend?s harbinger, but to that of the Author of Evil himself.?The Christian Knight had hitherto looked on as one stu-pefied, so strangely had this rencontre contradicted, in itsprogress and event, all that he had previously conjectured.He felt, however, at length, that it touched his honour tointerfere in behalf of his discomfited companion, and there-fore addressed himself to the victorious figure in the goat-skins.?Whosoe?er thou art,? he said, ?and whether of good or ofevil, know that I am sworn for the time to be true compan-ion to the Saracen whom thou holdest under thee; therefore,I pray thee to let him arise, else I will do battle with thee inhis behalf.??And a proper quarrel it were,? answered the Hamako, ?fora Crusader to do battle in?for the sake of an unbaptizeddog, to combat one of his own holy faith! Art thou comeforth to the wilderness to fight for the Crescent against theCross? A goodly soldier of God art thou to listen to thosewho sing the praises of Satan!?Yet, while he spoke thus, he arose himself, and, sufferingthe Saracen to rise also, returned him his cangiar, or pon-iard.?Thou seest to what a point of peril thy presumption hathbrought thee,? continued he of the goat-skins, now address-ing Sheerkohf, ?and by what weak means thy practised skilland boasted agility can be foiled, when such is Heaven?s plea-sure. Wherefore, beware, O Ilderim! for know that, were there 50The Talismannot a twinkle in the star of thy nativity which promises forthee something that is good and gracious in Heaven?s goodtime, we two had not parted till I had torn asunder the throatwhich so lately trilled forth blasphemies.??Hamako,? said the Saracen, without any appearance ofresenting the violent language and yet more violent assaultto which he had been subjected, ?I pray thee, good Hamako,to beware how thou dost again urge thy privilege over far;for though, as a good Moslem, I respect those whom Heavenhath deprived of ordinary reason, in order to endow themwith the spirit of prophecy, yet I like not other men?s handson the bridle of my horse, neither upon my own person.Speak, therefore, what thou wilt, secure of any resentmentfrom me; but gather so much sense as to apprehend that ifthou shalt again proffer me any violence, I will strike thyshagged head from thy meagre shoulders.?and to thee,friend Kenneth,? he added, as he remounted his steed, ?Imust needs say, that in a companion through the desert, Ilove friendly deeds better than fair words. Of the last thouhast given me enough; but it had been better to have aidedme more speedily in my struggle with this Hamako, whohad well-nigh taken my life in his frenzy,??By my faith,? said the Knight, ?I did somewhat fail?wassomewhat tardy in rendering thee instant help; but thestrangeness of the assailant, the suddenness of the scene?itwas as if thy wild and wicked lay had raised the devil amongus?and such was my confusion, that two or three minuteselapsed ere I could take to my weapon.??Thou art but a cold and considerate friend,? said theSaracen; ?and, had the Hamako been one grain more fran-tic, thy companion had been slain by thy side, to thy eternaldishonour, without thy stirring a finger in his aid, althoughthou satest by, mounted, and in arms.??By my word, Saracen,? said the Christian, ?if thou wilthave it in plain terms, I thought that strange figure was thedevil; and being of thy lineage, I knew not what family se-cret you might be communicating to each other, as you laylovingly rolling together on the sand.??Thy gibe is no answer, brother Kenneth,? said the Saracen;?for know, that had my assailant been in very deed the Princeof Darkness, thou wert bound not the less to enter into com-bat with him in thy comrade?s behalf. Know, also, that what- 51Sir Walter Scottever there may be of foul or of fiendish about the Hamakobelongs more to your lineage than to mine?this Hamakobeing, in truth, the anchorite whom thou art come hither tovisit.??This!? said Sir Kenneth, looking at the athletic yet wastedfigure before him??this! Thou mockest, Saracen?this can-not be the venerable Theodorick!??Ask himself, if thou wilt not believe me,? answeredSheerkohf; and ere the words had left his mouth, the hermitgave evidence in his own behalf.?I am Theodorick of Engaddi,? he said??I am the walkerof the desert?I am friend of the Cross, and flail of all infi-dels, heretics, and devil-worshippers. Avoid ye, avoid ye!Down with Mahound, Termagaunt, and all their adher-ents!??So saying, he pulled from under his shaggy garmenta sort of flail or jointed club, bound with iron, which hebrandished round his head with singular dexterity,?Thou seest thy saint,? said the Saracen, laughing, for thefirst time, at the unmitigated astonishment with which SirKenneth looked on the wild gestures and heard the waywardmuttering of Theodorick, who, after swinging his flail in everydirection, apparently quite reckless whether it encounteredthe head of either of his companions, finally showed his ownstrength, and the soundness of the weapon, by striking intofragments a large stone which lay near him.?This is a madman,? said Sir Kenneth.?Not the worse saint,? returned the Moslem, speaking ac-cording to the well-known Eastern belief, that madmen areunder the influence of immediate inspiration. ?Know, Chris-tian, that when one eye is extinguished, the other becomesmore keen; when one hand is cut off, the other becomesmore powerful; so, when our reason in human things is dis-turbed or destroyed, our view heavenward becomes moreacute and perfect.?Here the voice of the Saracen was drowned in that of thehermit, who began to hollo aloud in a wild, chanting tone,?I am Theodorick of Engaddi?I am the torch-brand of thedesert?I am the flail of the infidels! The lion and the leop-ard shall be my comrades, and draw nigh to my cell for shel-ter; neither shall the goat be afraid of their fangs. I am thetorch and the lantern?Kyrie Eleison!?He closed his song by a short race, and ended that again 52The Talismanby three forward bounds, which would have done him greatcredit in a gymnastic academy, but became his character ofhermit so indifferently that the Scottish Knight was alto-gether confounded and bewildered.The Saracen seemed to understand him better. ?You see,?he said, ?that he expects us to follow him to his cell, which,indeed, is our only place of refuge for the night. You are theleopard, from the portrait on your shield; I am the lion, asmy name imports; and by the goat, alluding to his garb ofgoat-skins, he means himself. We must keep him in sight,however, for he is as fleet as a dromedary.?In fact, the task was a difficult one, for though the rever-end guide stopped from time to time, and waved his hand,as if to encourage them to come on, yet, well acquaintedwith all the winding dells and passes of the desert, and giftedwith uncommon activity, which, perhaps, an unsettled stateof mind kept in constant exercise, he led the knights throughchasms and along footpaths where even the light-armedSaracen, with his well-trained barb, was in considerable risk,and where the iron-sheathed European and his over-burdenedsteed found themselves in such imminent peril as the riderwould gladly have exchanged for the dangers of a generalaction. Glad he was when, at length, after this wild race, hebeheld the holy man who had led it standing in front of acavern, with a large torch in his hand, composed of a pieceof wood dipped in bitumen, which cast a broad and flicker-ing light, and emitted a strong sulphureous smell.Undeterred by the stifling vapour, the knight threw him-self from his horse and entered the cavern, which affordedsmall appearance of accommodation. The cell was dividedinto two parts, in the outward of which were an altar of stoneand a crucifix made of reeds: this served the anchorite for hischapel. On one side of this outward cave the Christian knight,though not without scruple, arising from religious reverenceto the objects around, fastened up his horse, and arrangedhim for the night, in imitation of the Saracen, who gave himto understand that such was the custom of the place. Thehermit, meanwhile, was busied putting his inner apartmentin order to receive his guests, and there they soon joinedhim. At the bottom of the outer cave, a small aperture, closedwith a door of rough plank, led into the sleeping apartmentof the hermit, which was more commodious. The floor had 53Sir Walter Scottbeen brought to a rough level by the labour of the inhabitant,and then strewed with white sand, which he daily sprinkledwith water from a small fountain which bubbled out of therock in one corner, affording in that stifling climate, refresh-ment alike to the ear and the taste. Mattresses, wrought oftwisted flags, lay by the side of the cell; the sides, like the floor,had been roughly brought to shape, and several herbs andflowers were hung around them. Two waxen torches, whichthe hermit lighted, gave a cheerful air to the place, which wasrendered agreeable by its fragrance and coolness.There were implements of labour in one corner of the apart-ment, in another was a niche for a rude statue of the Virgin.A table and two chairs showed that they must be the handi-work of the anchorite, being different in their form fromOriental accommodations. The former was covered, not onlywith reeds and pulse, but also with dried flesh, whichTheodorick assiduously placed in such arrangement as shouldinvite the appetite of his guests. This appearance of courtesy,though mute, and expressed by gestures only, seemed to SirKenneth something entirely irreconcilable with his formerwild and violent demeanour. The movements of the hermitwere now become composed, and apparently it was only asense of religious humiliation which prevented his features,emaciated as they were by his austere mode of life, from be-ing majestic and noble. He trod his cell as one who seemedborn to rule over men, but who had abdicated his empire tobecome the servant of Heaven. Still, it must be allowed thathis gigantic size, the length of his unshaven locks and beard,and the fire of a deep-set and wild eye were rather attributesof a soldier than of a recluse.Even the Saracen seemed to regard the anchorite with someveneration, while he was thus employed, and he whisperedin a low tone to Sir Kenneth, ?The Hamako is now in hisbetter mind, but he will not speak until we have eaten?such is his vow.?It was in silence, accordingly, that Theodorick motionedto the Scot to take his place on one of the low chairs, whileSheerkohf placed himself, after the custom of his nation,upon a cushion of mats. The hermit then held up both hands,as if blessing the refreshment which he had placed before hisguests, and they proceeded to eat in silence as profound ashis own. To the Saracen this gravity was natural; and the 54The TalismanChristian imitated his taciturnity, while he employed histhoughts on the singularity of his own situation, and thecontrast betwixt the wild, furious gesticulations, loud cries,and fierce actions of Theodorick, when they first met him,and the demure, solemn, decorous assiduity with which henow performed the duties of hospitality.When their meal was ended, the hermit, who had not him-self eaten a morsel, removed the fragments from the table,and placing before the Saracen a pitcher of sherbet, assignedto the Scot a flask of wine.?Drink,? he said, ?my children??they were the first wordshe had spoken??the gifts of God are to be enjoyed, whenthe Giver is remembered.?Having said this, he retired to the-outward cell, probablyfor performance of his devotions, and left his guests togetherin the inner apartment; when Sir Kenneth endeavoured, byvarious questions, to draw from Sheerkohf what that Emirknew concerning his host. He was interested by more thanmere curiosity in these inquiries. Difficult as it was to recon-cile the outrageous demeanour of the recluse at his first ap-pearance with his present humble and placid behaviour, itseemed yet more impossible to think it consistent with thehigh consideration in which, according to what Sir Kennethhad learned, this hermit was held by the most enlighteneddivines of the Christian world. Theodorick, the hermit ofEngaddi, had, in that character, been the correspondent ofpopes and councils; to whom his letters, full of eloquentfervour, had described the miseries imposed by the unbe-lievers upon the Latin Christians in the Holy Land, in coloursscarce inferior to those employed at the Council of Clermontby the Hermit Peter, when he preached the first Crusade. Tofind, in a person so reverend and so much revered, the fran-tic gestures of a mad fakir, induced the Christian knight topause ere he could resolve to communicate to him certainimportant matters, which he had in charge from some of theleaders of the Crusade.It had been a main object of Sir Kenneth?s pilgrimage, at-tempted by a route so unusual, to make such communica-tions; but what he had that night seen induced him to pauseand reflect ere he proceeded to the execution of his commis-sion. From the Emir he could not extract much informa-tion, but the general tenor was as follows:?That, as he had 55Sir Walter Scottheard, the hermit had been once a brave and valiant soldier,wise in council and fortunate in battle, which last he couldeasily believe from the great strength and agility which hehad often seen him display; that he had appeared at Jerusa-lem in the character not of a pilgrim, but in that of one whohad devoted himself to dwell for the remainder of his life inthe Holy Land. Shortly afterwards, he fixed his residenceamid the scenes of desolation where they now found him,respected by the Latins for his austere devotion, and by theTurks and Arabs on account of the symptoms of insanitywhich he displayed, and which they ascribed to inspiration.It was from them he had the name of Hamako, which ex-presses such a character in the Turkish language. Sheerkohfhimself seemed at a loss how to rank their host. He had been,he said, a wise man, and could often for many hours to-gether speak lessons of virtue or wisdom, without the slight-est appearance of inaccuracy. At other times he was wild andviolent, but never before had he seen him so mischievouslydisposed as he had that day appeared to be. His rage waschiefly provoked by any affront to his religion; and therewas a story of some wandering Arabs, who had insulted hisworship and defaced his altar, and whom he had on thataccount attacked and slain with the short flail which he car-ried with him in lieu of all other weapons. This incident hadmade a great noise, and it was as much the fear of the hermit?siron flail as regard for his character as a Hamako which causedthe roving tribes to respect his dwelling and his chapel. Hisfame had spread so far that Saladin had issued particularorders that he should be spared and protected. He himself,and other Moslem lords of rank, had visited the cell morethan once, partly from curiosity, partly that they expectedfrom a man so learned as the Christian Hamako some in-sight into the secrets of futurity. ?He had,? continued theSaracen, ?a rashid, or observatory, of great height, contrivedto view the heavenly bodies, and particularly the planetarysystem?by whose movements and influences, as both Chris-tian and Moslem believed, the course of human events wasregulated, and might be predicted.?This was the substance of the Emir Sheerkohf?s informa-tion, and it left Sir Kenneth in doubt whether the characterof insanity arose from the occasional excessive fervour of thehermit?s zeal, or whether it was not altogether fictitious, and 56The Talismanassumed for the sake of the immunities which it afforded.Yet it seemed that the infidels had carried their complaisancetowards him to an uncommon length, considering the fa-naticism of the followers of Mohammed, in the midst ofwhom he was living, though the professed enemy of theirfaith. He thought also there was more intimacy of acquain-tance betwixt the hermit and the Saracen than the words ofthe latter had induced him to anticipate; and it had not es-caped him that the former had called the latter by a namedifferent from that which he himself had assumed. All theseconsiderations authorized caution, if not suspicion. He de-termined to observe his host closely, and not to be over-hastyin communicating with him on the important charge en-trusted to him.?Beware, Saracen,? he said; ?methinks our host?s imagina-tion wanders as well on the subject of names as upon othermatters. Thy name is Sheerkohf, and he called thee but nowby another.??My name, when in the tent of my father,? replied theKurdman, ?was Ilderim, and by this I am still distinguishedby many. In the field, and to soldiers, I am known as the Lionof the Mountain, being the name my good sword hath wonfor me. But hush, the Hamako comes?it is to warn us to rest.I know his custom; none must watch him at his vigils.?The anchorite accordingly entered, and folding his armson his bosom as he stood before them, said with a solemnvoice, ?Blessed be His name, who hath appointed the quietnight to follow the busy day, and the calm sleep to refreshthe wearied limbs and to compose the troubled spirit!?Both warriors replied ?Amen!? and, arising from the table,prepared to betake themselves to the couches, which theirhost indicated by waving his hand, as, making a reverence toeach, he again withdrew from the apartment.The Knight of the Leopard then disarmed himself of hisheavy panoply, his Saracen companion kindly assisting himto undo his buckler and clasps, until he remained in the closedress of chamois leather, which knights and men-at-armsused to wear under their harness. The Saracen, if he hadadmired the strength of his adversary when sheathed in steel,was now no less struck with the accuracy of proportion dis-played in his nervous and well-compacted figure. The knight,on the other hand, as, in exchange of courtesy, he assisted 57Sir Walter Scottthe Saracen to disrobe himself of his upper garments, that hemight sleep with more convenience, was, on his side, at aloss to conceive how such slender proportions and slimnessof figure could be reconciled with the vigour he had dis-played in personal contest.Each warrior prayed ere he addressed himself to his placeof rest. The Moslem turned towards his Keblah, the point towhich the prayer of each follower of the Prophet was to beaddressed, and murmured his heathen orisons; while theChristian, withdrawing from the contamination of theinfidel?s neighbourhood, placed his huge cross-handled swordupright, and kneeling before it as the sign of salvation, toldhis rosary with a devotion which was enhanced by the recol-lection of the scenes through which he had passed, and thedangers from which he had been rescued, in the course ofthe day. Both warriors, worn by toil and travel, were soonfast asleep, each on his separate pallet.CHAPTER IV.KENNETH THE SCOT was uncertain how long his senses hadbeen lost in profound repose, when he was roused to recol-lection by a sense of oppression on his chest, which at firstsuggested a flirting dream of struggling with a powerful op-ponent, and at length recalled him fully to his senses. Hewas about to demand who was there, when, opening his eyes,he beheld the figure of the anchorite, wild and savage-look-ing as we have described him, standing by his bedside, andpressing his right hand upon his breast, while he held a smallsilver lamp in the other.?Be silent,? said the hermit, as the prostrate knight lookedup in surprise; ?I have that to say to you which yonder infi-del must not hear.?These words he spoke in the French language, and not inthe lingua franca, or compound of Eastern and Europeandialects, which had hitherto been used amongst them.?Arise,? he continued, ?put on thy mantle; speak not, buttread lightly, and follow me.?Sir Kenneth arose, and took his sword. 58The Talisman?It needs not,? answered the anchorite, in a whisper; ?weare going where spiritual arms avail much, and fleshly weap-ons are but as the reed and the decayed gourd.?The knight deposited his sword by the bedside as before, and,armed only with his dagger, from which in this perilous coun-try he never parted, prepared to attend his mysterious host.The hermit then moved slowly forwards, and was followedby the knight, still under some uncertainty whether the darkform which glided on before to show him the path was not,in fact, the creation of a disturbed dream. They passed, likeshadows, into the outer apartment, without disturbing thepaynim Emir, who lay still buried in repose. Before the crossand altar, in the outward room, a lamp was still burning, amissal was displayed, and on the floor lay a discipline, orpenitential scourge of small cord and wire, the lashes of whichwere recently stained with blood?a token, no doubt, of thesevere penance of the recluse. Here Theodorick kneeled down,and pointed to the knight to take his place beside him uponthe sharp flints, which seemed placed for the purpose of ren-dering the posture of reverential devotion as uneasy as pos-sible. He read many prayers of the Catholic Church, andchanted, in a low but earnest voice, three of the penitentialpsalms. These last he intermixed with sighs, and tears, andconvulsive throbs, which bore witness how deeply he felt thedivine poetry which he recited. The Scottish knight assistedwith profound sincerity at these acts of devotion, his opin-ion of his host beginning, in the meantime, to be so muchchanged, that he doubted whether, from the severity of hispenance and the ardour of his prayers, he ought not to re-gard him as a saint; and when they arose from the ground,he stood with reverence before him, as a pupil before anhonoured master. The hermit was, on his side, silent andabstracted for the space of a few minutes.?Look into yonder recess, my son,? he said, pointing tothe farther corner of the cell; ?there thou wilt find a veil?bring it hither.?The knight obeyed, and in a small aperture cut out of thewall, and secured with a door of wicker, he found the veilinquired for. When he brought it to the light, he discoveredthat it was torn, and soiled in some places with some darksubstance. The anchorite looked at it with a deep but smoth-ered emotion, and ere he could speak to the Scottish knight, 59Sir Walter Scottwas compelled to vent his feelings in a convulsive groan.?Thou art now about to look upon the richest treasurethat the earth possesses,? he at length said; ?woe is me, thatmy eyes are unworthy to be lifted towards it! Alas! I am butthe vile and despised sign, which points out to the weariedtraveller a harbour of rest and security, but must itself re-main for ever without doors. In vain have I fled to the verydepths of the rocks, and the very bosom of the thirsty desert.Mine enemy hath found me?even he whom I have deniedhas pursued me to my fortresses.?He paused again for a moment, and turning to the Scot-tish knight, said, in a firmer tone of voice, ?You bring me agreeting from Richard of England???I come from the Council of Christian Princes,? said theknight; ?but the King of England being indisposed, I amnot honoured with his Majesty?s commands.??Your token?? demanded the recluse.Sir Kenneth hesitated. Former suspicions, and the marksof insanity which the hermit had formerly exhibited, rushedsuddenly on his thoughts; but how suspect a man whosemanners were so saintly? ?My password,? he said at length,?is this?Kings begged of a beggar.??It is right,? said the hermit, while he paused. ?I know youwell; but the sentinel upon his post?and mine is an impor-tant one?challenges friend as well as foe,?He then moved forward with the lamp, leading the wayinto the room which they had left. The Saracen lay on hiscouch, still fast asleep. The hermit paused by his side, andlooked down on him.?He sleeps,? he said, ?in darkness, and must not be awak-ened.?The attitude of the Emir did indeed convey the idea ofprofound repose. One arm, flung across his body, as he laywith his face half turned to the wall, concealed, with its looseand long sleeve, the greater part of his face; but the highforehead was yet visible. Its nerves, which during his wakinghours were so uncommonly active, were now motionless, asif the face had been composed of dark marble, and his longsilken eyelashes closed over his piercing and hawklike eyes.The open and relaxed hand, and the deep, regular, and softbreathing, all gave tokens of the most profound repose. Theslumberer formed a singular group along with the tall forms 60The Talismanof the hermit in his shaggy dress of goat-skins, bearing thelamp, and the knight in his close leathern coat?the formerwith an austere expression of ascetic gloom, the latter withanxious curiosity deeply impressed on his manly features.?He sleeps soundly,? said the hermit, in the same low toneas before; and repeating the words, though he had changedthe meaning from that which is literal to a metaphoricalsense??he sleeps in darkness, but there shall be for him adayspring.?O Ilderim, thy waking thoughts are yet as vainand wild as those which are wheeling their giddy dancethrough thy sleeping brain; but the trumpet shall be heard,and the dream shall be dissolved.?So saying, and making the knight a sign to follow him, thehermit went towards the altar, and passing behind it, presseda spring, which, opening without noise, showed a small irondoor wrought in the side of the cavern, so as to be almostimperceptible, unless upon the most severe scrutiny. Thehermit, ere he ventured fully to open the door, dropped someoil on the hinges, which the lamp supplied. A small stair-case, hewn in the rock, was discovered, when the iron doorwas at length completely opened.?Take the veil which I hold,? said the hermit, in a melan-choly tone, ?and blind mine eyes; For I may not look on thetreasure which thou art presently to behold, without sin andpresumption.?Without reply, the knight hastily muffled the recluse?s headin the veil, and the latter began to ascend the staircase as onetoo much accustomed to the way to require the use of light,while at the same time he held the lamp to the Scot, whofollowed him for many steps up the narrow ascent. At lengththey rested in a small vault of irregular form, in one nook ofwhich the staircase terminated, while in another corner acorresponding stair was seen to continue the ascent. In athird angle was a Gothic door, very rudely ornamented withthe usual attributes of clustered columns and carving, anddefended by a wicket, strongly guarded with iron, and stud-ded with large nails. To this last point the hermit directed hissteps, which seemed to falter as he approached it.?Put off thy shoes,? he said to his attendant; ?the groundon which thou standest is holy. Banish from thy innermostheart each profane and carnal thought, for to harbour suchwhile in this place were a deadly impiety.? 61Sir Walter ScottThe knight laid aside his shoes as he was commanded, andthe hermit stood in the meanwhile as if communing withhis soul in secret prayer, and when he again moved, com-manded the knight to knock at the wicket three times. Hedid so. The door opened spontaneously?at least Sir Ken-neth beheld no one?and his senses were at once assailed bya stream of the purest light, and by a strong and almost op-pressive sense of the richest perfumes. He stepped two orthree paces back, and it was the space of a minute ere herecovered the dazzling and overpowering effects of the sud-den change from darkness to light.When he entered the apartment in which this brilliant lustrewas displayed, he perceived that the light proceeded from acombination of silver lamps, fed with purest oil, and send-ing forth the richest odours, hanging by silver chains fromthe roof of a small Gothic chapel, hewn, like most part ofthe hermit?s singular mansion, out of the sound and solidrock. But whereas, in every other place which Sir Kennethhad seen, the labour employed upon the rock had been ofthe simplest and coarsest description, it had in this chapelemployed the invention and the chisels of the most able ar-chitects. The groined roofs rose from six columns on eachside, carved with the rarest skill; and the manner in whichthe crossings of the concave arches were bound together, asit were, with appropriate ornaments, were all in the finesttone of the architecture of the age. Corresponding to theline of pillars, there were on each side six richly-wroughtniches, each of which contained the image of one of the twelveapostles.At the upper and eastern end of the chapel stood the altar,behind which a very rich curtain of Persian silk, embroi-dered deeply with gold, covered a recess, containing, unques-tionably, some image or relic of no ordinary sanctity, inhonour of which this singular place of worship had beenerected, Under the persuasion that this must be the case, theknight advanced to the shrine, and kneeling down before it,repeated his devotions with fervency, during which his at-tention was disturbed by the curtain being suddenly raised,or rather pulled aside, how or by whom he saw not; but inthe niche which was thus disclosed he beheld a cabinet ofsilver and ebony, with a double folding-door, the wholeformed into the miniature resemblance of a Gothic church. 62The TalismanAs he gazed with anxious curiosity on the shrine, the twofolding-doors also flew open, discovering a large piece ofwood, on which were blazoned the words, vera crux; at thesame time a choir of female voices sung Gloria Patri. Theinstant the strain had ceased, the shrine was closed, and thecurtain again drawn, and the knight who knelt at the altarmight now continue his devotions undisturbed, in honourof the holy relic which had been just disclosed to his view.He did this under the profound impression of one who hadwitnessed, with his own eyes, an awful evidence of the truthof his religion; and it was some time ere, concluding hisorisons, he arose, and ventured to look around him for thehermit, who had guided him to this sacred and mysteriousspot. He beheld him, his head still muffled in the veil whichhe had himself wrapped around it, crouching, like a ratedhound, upon the threshold of the chapel; but, apparently,without venturing to cross it?the holiest reverence, the mostpenitential remorse, was expressed by his posture, whichseemed that of a man borne down and crushed to the earthby the burden of his inward feelings. It seemed to the Scotthat only the sense of the deepest penitence, remorse, andhumiliation could have thus prostrated a frame so strongand a spirit so fiery.He approached him as if to speak; but the recluse antici-pated his purpose, murmuring in stifled tones, from beneaththe fold in which his head was muffled, and which soundedlike a voice proceeding from the cerements of a corpse,??Abide, abide?happy thou that mayest?the vision is notyet ended.? So saying, he reared himself from the ground,drew back from the threshold on which he had hitherto lainprostrate, and closed the door of the chapel, which, securedby a spring bolt within, the snap of which resounded throughthe place, appeared so much like a part of the living rockfrom which the cavern was hewn, that Kenneth could hardlydiscern where the aperture had been. He was now alone inthe lighted chapel which contained the relic to which he hadlately rendered his homage, without other arms than his dag-ger, or other companion than his pious thoughts and daunt-less courage.Uncertain what was next to happen, but resolved to abidethe course of events, Sir Kenneth paced the solitary chapeltill about the time of the earliest cock-crowing. At this dead 63Sir Walter Scottseason, when night and morning met together, he heard,but from what quarter he could not discover, the sound ofsuch a small silver bell as is rung at the elevation of the hostin the ceremony, or sacrifice, as it has been called, of themass. The hour and the place rendered the sound fearfullysolemn, and, bold as he was, the knight withdrew himselfinto the farther nook of the chapel, at the end opposite tothe altar, in order to observe, without interruption, the con-sequences of this unexpected signal.He did not wait long ere the silken curtain was again with-drawn, and the relic again presented to his view. As he sunkreverentially on his knee, he heard the sound of the lauds, orearliest office of the Catholic Church, sung by female voices,which united together in the performance as they had donein the former service. The knight was soon aware that thevoices were no longer stationary in the distance, but ap-proached the chapel and became louder, when a door, im-perceptible when closed, like that by which he had himselfentered, opened on the other side of the vault, and gave thetones of the choir more room to swell along the ribbed archesof the roof.The knight fixed his eyes on the opening with breathlessanxiety, and, continuing to kneel in the attitude of devotionwhich the place and scene required, expected the consequenceof these preparations. A procession appeared about to issuefrom the door. First, four beautiful boys, whose arms, necks,and legs were bare, showing the bronze complexion of theEast, and contrasting with the snow-white tunics which theywore, entered the chapel by two and two. The first pair borecensers, which they swung from side to side, adding doublefragrance to the odours with which the chapel already wasimpregnated. The second pair scattered flowers.After these followed, in due and majestic order, the fe-males who composed the choir?six, who from their blackscapularies, and black veils over their white garments, ap-peared to be professed nuns of the order of Mount Carmel;and as many whose veils, being white, argued them to benovices, or occasional inhabitants in the cloister, who werenot as yet bound to it by vows. The former held in theirhands large rosaries, while the younger and lighter figureswho followed carried each a chaplet of red and white roses.They moved in procession around the chapel, without ap- 64The Talismanpearing to take the slightest notice of Kenneth, althoughpassing so near him that their robes almost touched him,while they continued to sing. The knight doubted not thathe was in one of those cloisters where the noble Christianmaidens had formerly openly devoted themselves to the ser-vices of the church. Most of them had been suppressed sincethe Mohammedans had reconquered Palestine, but many,purchasing connivance by presents, or receiving it from theclemency or contempt of the victors, still continued to ob-serve in private the ritual to which their vows had consecratedthem. Yet, though Kenneth knew this to be the case, the so-lemnity of the place and hour, the surprise at the sudden ap-pearance of these votaresses, and the visionary manner in whichthey moved past him, had such influence on his imaginationthat he could scarce conceive that the fair procession which hebeheld was formed of creatures of this world, so much didthey resemble a choir of supernatural beings, rendering hom-age to the universal object of adoration.Such was the knight?s first idea, as the procession passedhim, scarce moving, save just sufficiently to continue theirprogress; so that, seen by the shadowy and religious lightwhich the lamps shed through the clouds of incense whichdarkened the apartment, they appeared rather to glide thanto walk.But as a second time, in surrounding the chapel, they passedthe spot on which he kneeled, one of the white-stoled maid-ens, as she glided by him, detached from the chaplet whichshe carried a rosebud, which dropped from her fingers, per-haps unconsciously, on the foot of Sir Kenneth. The knightstarted as if a dart had suddenly struck his person; for, whenthe mind is wound up to a high pitch of feeling and expecta-tion, the slightest incident, if unexpected, gives fire to thetrain which imagination has already laid. But he suppressedhis emotion, recollecting how easily an incident so indiffer-ent might have happened, and that it was only the uniformmonotony of the movement of the choristers which madethe incident in the slightest degree remarkable.Still, while the procession, for the third time, surroundedthe chapel, the thoughts and the eyes of Kenneth followedexclusively the one among the novices who had dropped therosebud. Her step, her face, her form were so completelyassimilated to the rest of the choristers that it was impossible 65Sir Walter Scottto perceive the least marks of individuality; and yet Kenneth?sheart throbbed like a bird that would burst from its cage, asif to assure him, by its sympathetic suggestions, that the fe-male who held the right file on the second rank of the nov-ices was dearer to him, not only than all the rest that werepresent, but than the whole sex besides. The romantic pas-sion of love, as it was cherished, and indeed enjoined, by therules of chivalry, associated well with the no less romanticfeelings of devotion; and they might be said much more toenhance than to counteract each other. It was, therefore, witha glow of expectation that had something even of a religiouscharacter that Sir Kenneth, his sensations thrilling from hisheart to the ends of his fingers, expected some second sign ofthe presence of one who, he strongly fancied, had alreadybestowed on him the first. Short as the space was duringwhich the procession again completed a third perambula-tion of the chapel, it seemed an eternity to Kenneth. At lengththe form which he had watched with such devoted attentiondrew nigh. There was no difference betwixt that shroudedfigure and the others, with whom it moved in concert and inunison, until, just as she passed for the third time the kneel-ing Crusader, a part of a little and well-proportioned hand,so beautifully formed as to give the highest idea of the per-fect proportions of the form to which it belonged, stolethrough the folds of the gauze, like a moonbeam throughthe fleecy cloud of a summer night, and again a rosebud layat the feet of the Knight of the Leopard.This second intimation could not be accidental?it couldnot be fortuitous, the resemblance of that half-seen but beau-tiful female hand with one which his lips had once touched,and, while they touched it, had internally sworn allegianceto the lovely owner. Had further proof been wanting, therewas the glimmer of that matchless ruby ring on that snow-white finger, whose invaluable worth Kenneth would yet haveprized less than the slightest sign which that finger couldhave made; and, veiled too, as she was, he might see, bychance or by favour, a stray curl of the dark tresses, each hairof which was dearer to him a hundred times than a chain ofmassive gold. It was the lady of his love! But that she shouldhe here?in the savage and sequestered desert?amongvestals, who rendered themselves habitants of wilds and ofcaverns, that they might perform in secret those Christian 66The Talismanrites which they dared not assist in openly; that this shouldbe so, in truth and in reality, seemed too incredible?it mustbe a dream?a delusive trance of the imagination. Whilethese thoughts passed through the mind of Kenneth, thesame passage, by which the procession had entered the chapel,received them on their return. The young sacristans, the sablenuns, vanished successively through the open door. At lengthshe from whom he had received this double intimation passedalso; yet, in passing, turned her head, slightly indeed, butperceptibly, towards the place where he remained fixed as animage. He marked the last wave of her veil?it was gone?and a darkness sunk upon his soul, scarce less palpable thanthat which almost immediately enveloped his external sense;for the last chorister had no sooner crossed the threshold ofthe door than it shut with a loud sound, and at the sameinstant the voices of the choir were silent, the lights of thechapel were at once extinguished, and Sir Kenneth remainedsolitary and in total darkness. But to Kenneth, solitude, anddarkness, and the uncertainty of his mysterious situation wereas nothing?he thought not of them?cared not for them?cared for nought in the world save the flitting vision whichhad just glided past him, and the tokens of her favour whichshe had bestowed. To grope on the floor for the buds whichshe had dropped?to press them to his lips, to his bosom,now alternately, now together?to rivet his lips to the coldstones on which, as near as he could judge, she had so latelystepped?to play all the extravagances which strong affec-tion suggests and vindicates to those who yield themselvesup to it, were but the tokens of passionate love common toall ages. But it was peculiar to the times of chivalry that, inhis wildest rapture, the knight imagined of no attempt tofollow or to trace the object of such romantic attachment;that he thought of her as of a deity, who, having deigned toshow herself for an instant to her devoted worshipper, hadagain returned to the darkness of her sanctuary?or as aninfluential planet, which, having darted in some auspiciousminute one favourable ray, wrapped itself again in its veil ofmist. The motions of the lady of his love were to him thoseof a superior being, who was to move without watch or con-trol, rejoice him by her appearance, or depress him by herabsence, animate him by her kindness, or drive him to de-spair by her cruelty?all at her own free will, and without 67Sir Walter Scottother importunity or remonstrance than that expressed bythe most devoted services of the heart and sword of the cham-pion, whose sole object in life was to fulfil her commands,and, by the splendour of his own achievements, to exalt herfame.Such were the rules of chivalry, and of the love which wasits ruling principle. But Sir Kenneth?s attachment was ren-dered romantic by other and still more peculiar circumstances.He had never even heard the sound of his lady?s voice, thoughhe had often beheld her beauty with rapture. She moved in acircle which his rank of knighthood permitted him indeedto approach, but not to mingle with; and highly as he stooddistinguished for warlike skill and enterprise, still the poorScottish soldier was compelled to worship his divinity at adistance almost as great as divides the Persian from the sunwhich he adores. But when was the pride of woman too loftyto overlook the passionate devotion of a lover, however infe-rior in degree? Her eye had been on him in the tournament,her ear had heard his praises in the report of the battles whichwere daily fought; and while count, duke, and lord contendedfor her grace, it flowed, unwillingly perhaps at first, or evenunconsciously, towards the poor Knight of the Leopard, who,to support his rank, had little besides his sword. When shelooked, and when she listened, the lady saw and heard enoughto encourage her in a partiality which had at first crept onher unawares. If a knight?s personal beauty was praised, eventhe most prudish dames of the military court of Englandwould make an exception in favour of the Scottish Kenneth;and it oftentimes happened that, notwithstanding the veryconsiderable largesses which princes and peers bestowed onthe minstrels, an impartial spirit of independence would seizethe poet, and the harp was swept to the heroism of one whohad neither palfreys nor garments to bestow in guerdon ofhis applause.The moments when she listened to the praises of her loverbecame gradually more and more dear to the high-born Edith,relieving the flattery with which her ear was weary, and pre-senting to her a subject of secret contemplation, more wor-thy, as he seemed by general report, than those who sur-passed him in rank and in the gifts of fortune. As her atten-tion became constantly, though cautiously, fixed on Sir Ken-neth, she grew more and more convinced of his personal 68The Talismandevotion to herself and more and more certain in her mindthat in Kenneth of Scotland she beheld the fated knightdoomed to share with her through weal and woe?and theprospect looked gloomy and dangerous?the passionate at-tachment to which the poets of the age ascribed such univer-sal dominion, and which its manners and morals placed nearlyon the same rank with devotion itself.Let us not disguise the truth from our readers. When Edithbecame aware of the state of her own sentiments, chivalrousas were her sentiments, becoming a maiden not distant fromthe throne of England?gratified as her pride must have beenwith the mute though unceasing homage rendered to her bythe knight whom she had distinguished, there were momentswhen the feelings of the woman, loving and beloved, mur-mured against the restraints of state and form by which shewas surrounded, and when she almost blamed the timidityof her lover, who seemed resolved not to infringe them. Theetiquette, to use a modern phrase, of birth and rank, haddrawn around her a magical circle, beyond which Sir Ken-neth might indeed bow and gaze, but within which he couldno more pass than an evoked spirit can transgress the bound-aries prescribed by the rod of a powerful enchanter. Thethought involuntarily pressed on her that she herself mustventure, were it but the point of her fairy foot, beyond theprescribed boundary, if she ever hoped to give a lover so re-served and bashful an opportunity of so slight a favour asbut to salute her shoe-tie. There was an example?the notedprecedent of the ?King?s daughter of Hungary,? who thusgenerously encouraged the ?squire of low degree;? and Edith,though of kingly blood, was no king?s daughter, any morethan her lover was of low degree?fortune had put no suchextreme barrier in obstacle to their affections. Something,however, within the maiden?s bosom?that modest pridewhich throws fetters even on love itself forbade her, notwith-standing the superiority of her condition, to make those ad-vances, which, in every case, delicacy assigns to the othersex; above all, Sir Kenneth was a knight so gentle andhonourable, so highly accomplished, as her imagination atleast suggested, together with the strictest feelings of whatwas due to himself and to her, that however constrained herattitude might be while receiving his adorations, like theimage of some deity, who is neither supposed to feel nor to 69Sir Walter Scottreply to the homage of its votaries, still the idol feared that tostep prematurely from her pedestal would be to degrade her-self in the eyes of her devoted worshipper.Yet the devout adorer of an actual idol can even discoversigns of approbation in the rigid and immovable features ofa marble image; and it is no wonder that something, whichcould be as favourably interpreted, glanced from the brighteye of the lovely Edith, whose beauty, indeed, consisted rathermore in that very power of expression, than an absolute regu-larity of contour or brilliancy of complexion. Some slightmarks of distinction had escaped from her, notwithstandingher own jealous vigilance, else how could Sir Kenneth haveso readily and so undoubtingly recognized the lovely hand,of which scarce two fingers were visible from under the veil,or how could he have rested so thoroughly assured that twoflowers, successively dropped on the spot, were intended as arecognition on the part of his lady-love? By what train ofobservation?by what secret signs, looks, or gestures?bywhat instinctive freemasonry of love, this degree of intelli-gence came to subsist between Edith and her lover, we can-not attempt to trace; for we are old, and such slight vestigesof affection, quickly discovered by younger eyes, defy thepower of ours. Enough that such affection did subsist be-tween parties who had never even spoken to one another?though, on the side of Edith, it was checked by a deep senseof the difficulties and dangers which must necessarily attendthe further progress of their attachment; and upon that ofthe knight by a thousand doubts and fears lest he had over-estimated the slight tokens of the lady?s notice, varied, asthey necessarily were, by long intervals of apparent coldness,during which either the fear of exciting the observation ofothers, and thus drawing danger upon her lover, or that ofsinking in his esteem by seeming too willing to be won, madeher behave with indifference, and as if unobservant of hispresence.This narrative, tedious perhaps, but which the story ren-ders necessary, may serve to explain the state of intelligence,if it deserves so strong a name, betwixt the lovers, when Edith?sunexpected appearance in the chapel produced so powerfulan effect on the feelings of her knight. 70The TalismanCHAPTER V.Their necromantic forms in vainHaunt us on the tented plain;We bid these spectre shapes avaunt,Ashtaroth and Termagaunt.Warton.THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE, the deepest darkness, contin-ued to brood for more than an hour over the chapel in whichwe left the Knight of the Leopard still kneeling, alternatelyexpressing thanks to Heaven and gratitude to his lady forthe boon which had been vouchsafed to him. His own safety,his own destiny, for which he was at all times little anxious,had not now the weight of a grain of dust in his reflections.He was in the neighbourhood of Lady Edith; he had receivedtokens of her grace; he was in a place hallowed by relics ofthe most awful sanctity. A Christian soldier, a devoted lover,could fear nothing, think of nothing, but his duty to Heavenand his devoir to his lady.At the lapse of the space of time which we have noticed, ashrill whistle, like that with which a falconer calls his hawk,was heard to ring sharply through the vaulted chapel. it wasa sound ill suited to the place, and reminded Sir Kennethhow necessary it was he should be upon his guard. He startedfrom his knee, and laid his hand upon his poniard. A creak-ing sound, as of a screw or pulleys, succeeded, and a lightstreaming upwards, as from an opening in the floor, showedthat a trap-door had been raised or depressed. In less than aminute a long, skinny arm, partly naked, partly clothed in asleeve of red samite, arose out of the aperture, holding a lampas high as it could stretch upwards, and the figure to whichthe arm belonged ascended step by step to the level of thechapel floor. The form and face of the being who thus pre-sented himself were those of a frightful dwarf, with a largehead, a cap fantastically adorned with three peacock feath-ers, a dress of red samite, the richness of which rendered hisugliness more conspicuous, distinguished by gold braceletsand armlets, and a white silk sash, in which he wore a gold-hilted dagger. This singular figure had in his left hand a kindof broom. So soon as he had stepped from the aperture 71Sir Walter Scottthrough which he arose, he stood still, and, as if to showhimself more distinctly, moved the lamp which he held slowlyover his face and person, successively illuminating his wildand fantastic features, and his misshapen but nervous limbs.Though disproportioned in person, the dwarf was not sodistorted as to argue any want of strength or activity. WhileSir Kenneth gazed on this disagreeable object, the popularcreed occurred to his remembrance concerning the gnomesor earthly spirits which make their abode in the caverns ofthe earth; and so much did this figure correspond with ideashe had formed of their appearance, that he looked on it withdisgust, mingled not indeed with fear, but that sort of awewhich the presence of a supernatural creature may infuseinto the most steady bosom.The dwarf again whistled, and summoned from beneath acompanion. This second figure ascended in the same man-ner as the first; but it was a female arm in this second in-stance which upheld the lamp from the subterranean vaultout of which these presentments arose, and it was a femaleform, much resembling the first in shape and proportions,which slowly emerged from the floor. Her dress was also ofred samite, fantastically cut and flounced, as if she had beendressed for some exhibition of mimes or jugglers; and withthe same minuteness which her predecessor had exhibited,she passed the lamp over her face and person, which seemedto rival the male?s in ugliness. But with all this mostunfavourable exterior, there was one trait in the features ofboth which argued alertness and intelligence in the mostuncommon degree. This arose from the brilliancy of theireyes, which, deep-set beneath black and shaggy brows,gleamed with a lustre which, like that in the eye of the toad,seemed to make some amends for the extreme ugliness ofcountenance and person.Sir Kenneth remained as if spellbound, while this unlovelypair, moving round the chapel close to each other, appearedto perform the duty of sweeping it, like menials; but as theyused only one hand, the floor was not much benefited bythe exercise, which they plied with such oddity of gesturesand manner as befitted their bizarre and fantastic appear-ance. When they approached near to the knight in the courseof their occupation, they ceased to use their brooms; andplacing themselves side by side, directly opposite to Sir Ken- 72The Talismanneth, they again slowly shifted the lights which they held, soas to allow him distinctly to survey features which were notrendered more agreeable by being brought nearer, and toobserve the extreme quickness and keenness with which theirblack and glittering eyes flashed back the light of the lamps.They then turned the gleam of both lights upon the knight,and having accurately surveyed him, turned their faces toeach other, and set up a loud, yelling laugh, which resoundedin his ears. The sound was so ghastly that Sir Kenneth startedat hearing it, and hastily demanded, in the name of God,who they were who profaned that holy place with such anticgestures and elritch exclamations.?I am the dwarf Nectabanus,? said the abortion-seemingmale, in a voice corresponding to his figure, and resemblingthe voice of the night-crow more than any sound which isheard by daylight.?And I am Guenevra, his lady and his love,? replied thefemale, in tones which, being shriller, were yet wilder thanthose of her companion.?Wherefore are you here?? again demanded the knight,scarcely yet assured that they were human beings which hesaw before him.?I am,? replied the male dwarf, with much assumed grav-ity and dignity, ?the twelfth Imaum. I am MohammedMohadi, the guide and the conductor of the faithful. A hun-dred horses stand ready saddled for me and my train at theHoly City, and as many at the City of Refuge. I am he whoshall bear witness, and this is one of my houris.??Thou liest!? answered the female, interrupting her com-panion, in tones yet shriller than his own; ?I am none of thyhouris, and thou art no such infidel trash as the Mohammedof whom thou speakest. May my curse rest upon his coffin!I tell thee, thou ass of Issachar, thou art King Arthur of Brit-ain, whom the fairies stole away from the field of Avalon;and I am Dame Guenevra, famed for her beauty.??But in truth, noble sir,? said the male, ?we are distressedprinces, dwelling under the wing of King Guy of Jerusalem,until he was driven out from his own nest by the foul infi-dels?Heaven?s bolts consume them!??Hush,? said a voice from the side upon which the knighthad entered??hush, fools, and begone; your ministry isended.? 73Sir Walter ScottThe dwarfs had no sooner heard the command than, gib-bering in discordant whispers to each other, they blew outtheir lights at once, and left the knight in utter darkness,which, when the pattering of their retiring feet had died away,was soon accompanied by its fittest companion, total silence.The knight felt the departure of these unfortunate creaturesa relief. He could not, from their language, manners, and ap-pearance, doubt that they belonged to the degraded class ofbeings whom deformity of person and weakness of intellectrecommended to the painful situation of appendages to greatfamilies, where their personal appearance and imbecility werefood for merriment to the household. Superior in no respectto the ideas and manners of his time, the Scottish knight might,at another period, have been much amused by the mummeryof these poor effigies of humanity; but now their appearance,gesticulations, and language broke the train of deep and sol-emn feeling with which he was impressed, and he rejoiced inthe disappearance of the unhappy objects.A few minutes after they had retired, the door at which hehad entered opened slowly, and remaining ajar, discovered afaint light arising from a lantern placed upon the threshold.Its doubtful and wavering gleam showed a dark form reclinedbeside the entrance, but without its precincts, which, on ap-proaching it more nearly, he recognized to be the hermit,crouching in the same humble posture in which he had at firstlaid himself down, and which, doubtless, he had retained dur-ing the whole time of his guest?s continuing in the chapel.?All is over,? said the hermit, as he heard the knight ap-proaching, ?and the most wretched of earthly sinners, withhim who should think himself most honoured and most happyamong the race of humanity, must retire from this place. Takethe light, and guide me down the descent, for I must not un-cover my eyes until I am far from this hallowed spot.?The Scottish knight obeyed in silence, for a solemn andyet ecstatic sense of what he had seen had silenced even theeager workings of curiosity. He led the way, with consider-able accuracy, through the various secret passages and stairsby which they had ascended, until at length they found them-selves in the outward cell of the hermit?s cavern.?The condemned criminal is restored to his dungeon, re-prieved from one miserable day to another, until his awfulJudge shall at length appoint the well-deserved sentence to 74The Talismanbe carried into execution.?As the hermit spoke these words, he laid aside the veil withwhich his eyes had been bound, and looked at it with a sup-pressed and hollow sigh. No sooner had he restored it to thecrypt from which he had caused the Scot to bring it, than hesaid hastily and sternly to his companion; ?Begone, begone?to rest, to rest. You may sleep?you can sleep?I neither cannor may.?Respecting the profound agitation with which this was spo-ken, the knight retired into the inner cell; but casting backhis eye as he left the exterior grotto, he beheld the anchoritestripping his shoulders with frantic haste of their shaggymantle, and ere he could shut the frail door which separatedthe two compartments of the cavern, he heard the clang ofthe scourge and the groans of the penitent under his self-inflicted penance. A cold shudder came over the knight ashe reflected what could be the foulness of the sin, what thedepth of the remorse, which, apparently, such severe pen-ance could neither cleanse nor assuage. He told his beadsdevoutly, and flung himself on his rude couch, after a glanceat the still sleeping Moslem, and, wearied by the various scenesof the day and the night, soon slept as sound as infancy.Upon his awaking in the morning, he held certain confer-ences with the hermit upon matters of importance, and theresult of their intercourse induced him to remain for twodays longer in the grotto. He was regular, as became a pil-grim, in his devotional exercises, but was not again admittedto the chapel in which he had seen such wonders. 75Sir Walter ScottCHAPTER VI.Now change the scene?and let the trumpets sound,For we must rouse the lion from his lair.Old Play.THE SCENE must change, as our programme has announced,from the mountain wilderness of Jordan to the camp of KingRichard of England, then stationed betwixt Jean d?Acre andAscalon, and containing that army with which he of the lionheart had promised himself a triumphant march to Jerusa-lem, and in which he would probably have succeeded, if nothindered by the jealousies of the Christian princes engagedin the same enterprise, and the offence taken by them at theuncurbed haughtiness of the English monarch, and Richard?sunveiled contempt for his brother sovereigns, who, his equalsin rank, were yet far his inferiors in courage, hardihood, andmilitary talents. Such discords, and particularly those betwixtRichard and Philip of France, created disputes and obstacleswhich impeded every active measure proposed by the heroicthough impetuous Richard, while the ranks of the Crusad-ers were daily thinned, not only by the desertion of indi-viduals, but of entire bands, headed by their respective feu-dal leaders, who withdrew from a contest in which they hadceased to hope for success.The effects of the climate became, as usual, fatal to sol-diers from the north, and the more so that the dissolute li-cense of the Crusaders, forming a singular contrast to theprinciples and purpose of their taking up arms, rendered themmore easy victims to the insalubrious influence of burningheat and chilling dews. To these discouraging causes of losswas to be added the sword of the enemy. Saladin, than whomno greater name is recorded in Eastern history, had learned,to his fatal experience, that his light-armed followers werelittle able to meet in close encounter with the iron-cladFranks, and had been taught, at the same time, to appre-hend and dread the adventurous character of his antagonistRichard. But if his armies were more than once routed withgreat slaughter, his numbers gave the Saracen the advantagein those lighter skirmishes, of which many were inevitable.As the army of his assailants decreased, the enterprises of 76The Talismanthe Sultan became more numerous and more bold in thisspecies of petty warfare. The camp of the Crusaders was sur-rounded, and almost besieged, by clouds of light cavalry, re-sembling swarms of wasps, easily crushed when they are oncegrasped, but furnished with wings to elude superior strength,and stings to inflict harm and mischief. There was perpetualwarfare of posts and foragers, in which many valuable liveswere lost, without any corresponding object being gained;convoys were intercepted, and communications were cut off.The Crusaders had to purchase the means of sustaining life,by life itself; and water, like that of the well of Bethlehem,longed for by King David, one of its ancient monarchs, wasthen, as before, only obtained by the expenditure of blood.These evils were in a great measure counterbalanced bythe stern resolution and restless activity of King Richard,who, with some of his best knights, was ever on horseback,ready to repair to any point where danger occurred, and of-ten not only bringing unexpected succour to the Christians,but discomfiting the infidels when they seemed most secureof victory. But even the iron frame of Coeur de Lion couldnot support without injury the alternations of the unwhole-some climate, joined to ceaseless exertions of body and mind.He became afflicted with one of those slow and wasting fe-vers peculiar to Asia, and in despite of his great strength andstill greater courage, grew first unfit to mount on horseback,and then unable to attend the councils of war which werefrom time to time held by the Crusaders. It was difficult tosay whether this state of personal inactivity was rendered moregalling or more endurable to the English monarch by theresolution of the council to engage in a truce of thirty dayswith the Sultan Saladin; for on the one hand, if he was in-censed at the delay which this interposed to the progress ofthe great enterprise, he was, on the other, somewhat con-soled by knowing that others were not acquiring laurels whilehe remained inactive upon a sick-bed,That, however, which Coeur de Lion could least excusewas the general inactivity which prevailed in the camp of theCrusaders so soon as his illness assumed a serious aspect;and the reports which he extracted from his unwilling atten-dants gave him to understand that the hopes of the host hadabated in proportion to his illness, and that the interval oftruce was employed, not in recruiting their numbers, reani- 77Sir Walter Scottmating their courage, fostering their spirit of conquest, andpreparing for a speedy and determined advance upon theHoly City, which was the object of their expedition, but insecuring the camp occupied by their diminished followerswith trenches, palisades, and other fortifications, as if pre-paring rather to repel an attack from a powerful enemy sosoon as hostilities should recommence, than to assume theproud character of conquerors and assailants.The English king chafed under these reports, like the im-prisoned lion viewing his prey from the iron barriers of hiscage. Naturally rash and impetuous, the irritability of histemper preyed on itself. He was dreaded by his attendantsand even the medical assistants feared to assume the neces-sary authority which a physician, to do justice to his patient,must needs exercise over him. One faithful baron, who, per-haps, from the congenial nature of his disposition, was de-voutly attached to the King?s person, dared alone to comebetween the dragon and his wrath, and quietly, but firmly,maintained a control which no other dared assume over thedangerous invalid, and which Thomas de Multon only exer-cised because he esteemed his sovereign?s life and honourmore than he did the degree of favour which he might lose,or even the risk which he might incur, in nursing a patientso intractable, and whose displeasure was so perilous.Sir Thomas was the Lord of Gilsland, in Cumberland, andin an age when surnames and titles were not distinctly at-tached, as now, to the individuals who bore them, he wascalled by the Normans the Lord de Vaux; and in English bythe Saxons, who clung to their native language, and wereproud of the share of Saxon blood in this renowned warrior?sveins, he was termed Thomas, or, more familiarly, Thom ofthe Gills, or Narrow Valleys, from which his extensive do-mains derived their well-known appellation.This chief had been exercised in almost all the wars, whetherwaged betwixt England and Scotland, or amongst the vari-ous domestic factions which then tore the former countryasunder, and in all had been distinguished, as well from hismilitary conduct as his personal prowess. He was, in otherrespects, a rude soldier, blunt and careless in his bearing, andtaciturn?nay, almost sullen?in his habits of society, andseeming, at least, to disclaim all knowledge of policy and ofcourtly art. There were men, however, who pretended to look 78The Talismandeeply into character, who asserted that the Lord de Vauxwas not less shrewd and aspiring than he was blunt and bold,and who thought that, while he assimilated himself to theking?s own character of blunt hardihood, it was, in somedegree at least, with an eye to establish his favour, and togratify his own hopes of deep-laid ambition. But no one caredto thwart his schemes, if such he had, by rivalling him in thedangerous occupation of daily attendance on the sick-bed ofa patient whose disease was pronounced infectious, and moreespecially when it was remembered that the patient was Coeurde Lion, suffering under all the furious impatience of a sol-dier withheld from battle, and a sovereign sequestered fromauthority; and the common soldiers, at least in the Englisharmy, were generally of opinion that De Vaux attended onthe King like comrade upon comrade, in the honest and dis-interested frankness of military friendship contracted betweenthe partakers of daily dangers.It was on the decline of a Syrian day that Richard lay onhis couch of sickness, loathing it as much in mind as hisillness made it irksome to his body. His bright blue eye, whichat all times shone with uncommon keenness and splendour,had its vivacity augmented by fever and mental impatience,and glanced from among his curled and unshorn locks ofyellow hair as fitfully and as vividly as the last gleams of thesun shoot through the clouds of an approaching thunder-storm, which still, however, are gilded by its beams. His manlyfeatures showed the progress of wasting illness, and his beard,neglected and untrimmed, had overgrown both lips and chin.Casting himself from side to side, now clutching towardshim the coverings, which at the next moment he flung asimpatiently from him, his tossed couch and impatient ges-tures showed at once the energy and the reckless impatienceof a disposition whose natural sphere was that of the mostactive exertion.Beside his couch stood Thomas de Vaux, in face, attitude,and manner the strongest possible contrast to the sufferingmonarch. His stature approached the gigantic, and his hairin thickness might have resembled that of Samson, thoughonly after the Israelitish champion?s locks had passed underthe shears of the Philistines, for those of De Vaux were cutshort, that they might be enclosed under his helmet. Thelight of his broad, large hazel eye resembled that of the au- 79Sir Walter Scotttumn morn; and it was only perturbed for a moment, whenfrom time to time it was attracted by Richard?s vehementmarks of agitation and restlessness. His features, thoughmassive like his person, might have been handsome beforethey were defaced with scars; his upper lip, after the fashionof the Normans, was covered with thick moustaches, whichgrew so long and luxuriantly as to mingle with his hair, and,like his hair, were dark brown, slightly brindled with grey.His frame seemed of that kind which most readily defiesboth toil and climate, for he was thin-flanked, broad-chested,long-armed, deep-breathed, and strong-limbed. He had notlaid aside his buff-coat, which displayed the cross cut on theshoulder, for more than three nights, enjoying but suchmomentary repose as the warder of a sick monarch?s couchmight by snatches indulge. This Baron rarely changed hisposture, except to administer to Richard the medicine orrefreshments which none of his less favoured attendants couldpersuade the impatient monarch to take; and there was some-thing affecting in the kindly yet awkward manner in whichhe discharged offices so strangely contrasted with his bluntand soldierly habits and manners.The pavilion in which these personages were, had, as be-came the time, as well as the personal character of Richard,more of a warlike than a sumptuous or royal character. Weap-ons offensive and defensive, several of them of strange andnewly-invented construction, were scattered about the tentedapartment, or disposed upon the pillars which supported it.Skins of animals slain in the chase were stretched on theground, or extended along the sides of the pavilion; and upona heap of these silvan spoils lay three alans, as they were thencalled (wolf-greyhounds, that is), of the largest size, and aswhite as snow. Their faces, marked with many a scar fromclutch and fang, showed their share in collecting the tro-phies upon which they reposed; and their eyes, fixed fromtime to time with an expressive stretch and yawn upon thebed of Richard, evinced how much they marvelled at andregretted the unwonted inactivity which they were compelledto share. These were but the accompaniments of the soldierand huntsman; but on a small table close by the bed wasplaced a shield of wrought steel, of triangular form, bearingthe three lions passant first assumed by the chivalrous mon-arch, and before it the golden circlet, resembling much a 80The Talismanducal coronet, only that it was higher in front than behind,which, with the purple velvet and embroidered tiara thatlined it, formed then the emblem of England?s sovereignty.Beside it, as if prompt for defending the regal symbol, lay amighty curtal-axe, which would have wearied the arm of anyother than Coeur de Lion.In an outer partition of the pavilion waited two or threeofficers of the royal household, depressed, anxious for theirmaster?s health, and not less so for their own safety, in case ofhis decease. Their gloomy apprehensions spread themselvesto the warders without, who paced about in downcast andsilent contemplation, or, resting on their halberds, stood mo-tionless on their post, rather like armed trophies than livingwarriors.?So thou hast no better news to bring me from without,Sir Thomas!? said the King, after a long and perturbed si-lence, spent in the feverish agitation which we have endeav-oured to describe. ?All our knights turned women, and ourladies become devotees, and neither, a spark of valour nor ofgallantry to enlighten a camp which contains the choicest ofEurope?s chivalry?ha!??The truce, my lord,? said De Vaux, with the same pa-tience with which he had twenty times repeated the explana-tion??the truce prevents us bearing ourselves as men of ac-tion; and for the ladies, I am no great reveller, as is well knownto your Majesty, and seldom exchange steel and buff for vel-vet and gold?but thus far I know, that our choicest beau-ties are waiting upon the Queen?s Majesty and the Princess,to a pilgrimage to the convent of Engaddi, to accomplishtheir vows for your Highness?s deliverance from this trouble.??And is it thus,? said Richard, with the impatience of in-disposition, ?that royal matrons and maidens should riskthemselves, where the dogs who defile the land have as littletruth to man as they have faith towards God???Nay, my lord,? said De Vaux, ?they have Saladin?s wordfor their safety.??True, true!? replied Richard; ?and I did the heathen Soldaninjustice?I owe him reparation for it. Would God I werebut fit to offer it him upon my body between the two hosts?Christendom and heathenesse both looking on!?As Richard spoke, he thrust his right arm out of bed nakedto the shoulder, and painfully raising himself in his couch, 81Sir Walter Scottshook his clenched hand, as if it grasped sword or battle-axe,and was then brandished over the jewelled turban of theSoldan. It was not without a gentle degree of violence, whichthe King would scarce have endured from another, that DeVaux, in his character of sick-nurse, compelled his royalmaster to replace himself in the couch, and covered his sin-ewy arm, neck, and shoulders with the care which a motherbestows upon an impatient child.?Thou art a rough nurse, though a willing one, De Vaux,?said the King, laughing with a bitter expression, while hesubmitted to the strength which he was unable to resist;?methinks a coif would become thy lowering features as wellas a child?s biggin would beseem mine. We should be a babeand nurse to frighten girls with.??We have frightened men in our time, my liege,? said DeVaux; ?and, I trust, may live to frighten them again. What isa fever-fit, that we should not endure it patiently, in order toget rid of it easily???Fever-fit!? exclaimed Richard impetuously; ?thou mayestthink, and justly, that it is a fever-fit with me; but what is itwith all the other Christian princes?with Philip of France,with that dull Austrian, with him of Montserrat, with theHospitallers, with the Templars?what is it with all them? Iwill tell thee. It is a cold palsy, a dead lethargy, a disease thatdeprives them of speech and action, a canker that has eateninto the heart of all that is noble, and chivalrous, and virtu-ous among them?that has made them false to the noblestvow ever knights were sworn to?has made them indifferentto their fame, and forgetful of their God!??For the love of Heaven, my liege,? said De Vaux, ?take itless violently?you will be heard without doors, where suchspeeches are but too current already among the commonsoldiery, and engender discord and contention in the Chris-tian host. Bethink you that your illness mars the mainspringof their enterprise; a mangonel will work without screw andlever better than the Christian host without King Richard.??Thou flatterest me, De Vaux,? said Richard, and not in-sensible to the power of praise, he reclined his head on thepillow with a more deliberate attempt to repose than he hadyet exhibited. But Thomas de Vaux was no courtier; thephrase which had offered had risen spontaneously to his lips,and he knew not how to pursue the pleasing theme so as to 82The Talismansoothe and prolong the vein which he had excited. He wassilent, therefore, until, relapsing into his moody contempla-tions, the King demanded of him sharply, ?Despardieux! Thisis smoothly said to soothe a sick man; but does a league ofmonarchs, an assemblage or nobles, a convocation of all thechivalry of Europe, droop with the sickness of one man,though he chances to be King of England? Why shouldRichard?s illness, or Richard?s death, check the march of thirtythousand men as brave as himself? When the master stag isstruck down, the herd do not disperse upon his fall; whenthe falcon strikes the leading crane, another takes the guid-ance of the phalanx. Why do not the powers assemble andchoose some one to whom they may entrust the guidance ofthe host???Forsooth, and if it please your Majesty,? said De Vaux, ?Ihear consultations have been held among the royal leadersfor some such purpose.??Ha!? exclaimed Richard, his jealousy awakened, givinghis mental irritation another direction, ?am I forgot by myallies ere I have taken the last sacrament? Do they hold medead already? But no, no, they are right. And whom do theyselect as leader of the Christian host???Rank and dignity,? said De Vaux, ?point to the King ofFrance.??Oh, ay,? answered the English monarch, ?Philip of Franceand Navarre?Denis Mountjoie?his most Christian Maj-esty! Mouth-filling words these! There is but one risk ?thathe might mistake the words en arriere for en avant, and leadus back to Paris, instead of marching to Jerusalem. His poli-tic head has learned by this time that there is more to begotten by oppressing his feudatories, and pillaging his allies,than fighting with the Turks for the Holy Sepulchre.??They might choose the Archduke of Austria,? said DeVaux.?What! because he is big and burly like thyself, Thomas?nearly as thick-headed, but without thy indifference to dan-ger and carelessness of offence? I tell thee that Austria has inall that mass of flesh no bolder animation than is afforded bythe peevishness of a wasp and the courage of a wren. Outupon him! He a leader of chivalry to deeds of glory! Givehim a flagon of Rhenish to drink with his besmirched baaren-hauters and lance-knechts.? 83Sir Walter Scott?There is the Grand Master of the Templars,? continuedthe baron, not sorry to keep his master?s attention engagedon other topics than his own illness, though at the expenseof the characters of prince and potentate. ?There is the GrandMaster of the Templars,? he continued, ?undaunted, skilful,brave in battle, and sage in council, having no separate king-doms of his own to divert his exertions from the recovery ofthe Holy Land?what thinks your Majesty of the Master asa general leader of the Christian host???Ha, Beau-Seant?? answered the King. ?Oh, no exceptioncan be taken to Brother Giles Amaury; he understands theordering of a battle, and the fighting in front when it begins.But, Sir Thomas, were it fair to take the Holy Land from theheathen Saladin, so full of all the virtues which may distin-guish unchristened man, and give it to Giles Amaury, a worsepagan than himself, an idolater, a devil-worshipper, a necro-mancer, who practises crimes the most dark and unnaturalin the vaults and secret places of abomination and darkness???The Grand Master of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusa-lem is not tainted by fame, either with heresy or magic,? saidThomas de Vaux.?But is he not a sordid miser?? said Richard hastily; ?hashe not been suspected?ay, more than suspected?of sellingto the infidels those advantages which they would never havewon by fair force? Tush, man, better give the army to bemade merchandise of by Venetian skippers and Lombardypedlars, than trust it to the Grand Master of St. John.??Well, then, I will venture but another guess,? said theBaron de Vaux. ?What say you to the gallant Marquis ofMontserrat, so wise, so elegant, such a good man-at-arms???Wise??cunning, you would say,? replied Richard; ?el-egant in a lady?s chamber, if you will. Oh, ay, Conrade ofMontserrat?who knows not the popinjay? Politic and ver-satile, he will change you his purposes as often as the trim-mings of his doublet, and you shall never be able to guessthe hue of his inmost vestments from their outward colours.A man-at-arms? Ay, a fine figure on horseback, and can bearhim well in the tilt-yard, and at the barriers, when swordsare blunted at point and edge, and spears are tipped withtrenchers of wood instead of steel pikes. Wert thou not withme when I said to that same gay Marquis, ?Here we be, threegood Christians, and on yonder plain there pricks a band of 84The Talismansome threescore Saracens?what say you to charge thembriskly? There are but twenty unbelieving miscreants to eachtrue knight.??I recollect the Marquis replied,? said De Vaux, ?that hislimbs were of flesh, not of iron, and that he would ratherbear the heart of a man than of a beast, though that beastwere the lion, But I see how it is?we shall end where webegan, without hope of praying at the Sepulchre until Heavenshall restore King Richard to health.?At this grave remark Richard burst out into a hearty fit oflaughter, the first which he had for some time indulged in.?Why what a thing is conscience,? he said, ?that through itsmeans even such a thick-witted northern lord as thou canstbring thy sovereign to confess his folly! It is true that, didthey not propose themselves as fit to hold my leading-staff,little should I care for plucking the silken trappings off thepuppets thou hast shown me in succession. What concernsit me what fine tinsel robes they swagger in, unless whenthey are named as rivals in the glorious enterprise to which Ihave vowed myself? Yes, De Vaux, I confess my weakness,and the wilfulness of my ambition. The Christian camp con-tains, doubtless, many a better knight than Richard of En-gland, and it would be wise and worthy to assign to the bestof them the leading of the host. But,? continued the warlikemonarch, raising himself in his bed, and shaking the coverfrom his head, while his eyes sparkled as they were wont todo on the eve of battle, ?were such a knight to plant thebanner of the Cross on the Temple of Jerusalem while I wasunable to bear my share in the noble task, he should, so soonas I was fit to lay lance in rest, undergo my challenge tomortal combat, for having diminished my fame, and pressedin before to the object of my enterprise. But hark, what trum-pets are those at a distance???Those of King Philip, as I guess, my liege,? said the stoutEnglishman.?Thou art dull of ear, Thomas,? said the King, endeavour-ing to start up; ?hearest thou not that clash and clang? ByHeaven, the Turks are in the camp?I hear their lelies.? [Thewar-cries of the Moslemah.]He again endeavoured to get out of bed, and De Vaux wasobliged to exercise his own great strength, and also to sum-mon the assistance of the chamberlains from the inner tent, 85Sir Walter Scottto restrain him.?Thou art a false traitor, De Vaux,? said the incensed mon-arch, when, breathless and exhausted with struggling, he wascompelled to submit to superior strength, and to repose inquiet on his couch. ?I would I were?I would I were butstrong enough to dash thy brains out with my battle-axe!??I would you had the strength, my liege,? said De Vaux,?and would even take the risk of its being so employed. Theodds would be great in favour of Christendom were ThomasMulton dead and Coeur de Lion himself again.??Mine honest faithful servant,? said Richard, extendinghis hand, which the baron reverentially saluted, ?forgive thymaster?s impatience of mood. It is this burning fever whichchides thee, and not thy kind master, Richard of England.But go, I prithee, and bring me word what strangers are inthe camp, for these sounds are not of Christendom.?De Vaux left the pavilion on the errand assigned, and inhis absence, which he had resolved should be brief, he chargedthe chamberlains, pages, and attendants to redouble theirattention on their sovereign, with threats of holding them toresponsibility, which rather added to than diminished theirtimid anxiety in the discharge of their duty; for next, per-haps, to the ire of the monarch himself, they dreaded that ofthe stern and inexorable Lord of Gilsland. [Sir ThomasMulton of Gilsland.] 86The TalismanCHAPTER VII.There never was a time on the march parts yet,When Scottish with English met,But it was marvel if the red blood ran notAs the rain does in the street.Battle of Otterbourne.A CONSIDERABLE BAND of Scottish warriors had joined theCrusaders, and had naturally placed themselves under thecommand of the English monarch, being, like his nativetroops, most of them of Saxon and Norman descent, speak-ing the same languages, possessed, some of them, of Englishas well as Scottish demesnes, and allied in some cases byblood and intermarriage. The period also preceded that whenthe grasping ambition of Edward I. gave a deadly andenvenomed character to the wars betwixt the two nations?the English fighting for the subjugation of Scotland, and theScottish, with all the stern determination and obstinacy whichhas ever characterized their nation, for the defence of theirindependence, by the most violent means, under the mostdisadvantageous circumstances, and at the most extremehazard. As yet, wars betwixt the two nations, though fierceand frequent, had been conducted on principles of fair hos-tility, and admitted of those softening shades by which cour-tesy and the respect for open and generous foemen qualifyand mitigate the horrors of war. In time of peace, therefore,and especially when both, as at present, were engaged in war,waged in behalf of a common cause, and rendered dear tothem by their ideas of religion, the adventurers of both coun-tries frequently fought side by side, their national emulationserving only to stimulate them to excel each other in theirefforts against the common enemy.The frank and martial character of Richard, who made nodistinction betwixt his own subjects and those of William ofScotland, excepting as they bore themselves in the field ofbattle, tended much to conciliate the troops of both nations.But upon his illness, and the disadvantageous circumstancesin which the Crusaders were placed, the national disunionbetween the various bands united in the Crusade, began todisplay itself, just as old wounds break out afresh in the hu- 87Sir Walter Scottman body when under the influence of disease or debility.The Scottish and English, equally jealous and high-spir-ited, and apt to take offence?the former the more so, be-cause the poorer and the weaker nation?began to fill up byinternal dissension the period when the truce forbade themto wreak their united vengeance on the Saracens. Like thecontending Roman chiefs of old, the Scottish would admitno superiority, and their southern neighbours would brookno equality. There were charges and recriminations, and boththe common soldiery and their leaders and commanders,who had been good comrades in time of victory, lowered oneach other in the period of adversity, as if their union hadnot been then more essential than ever, not only to the suc-cess of their common cause, but to their joint safety. Thesame disunion had begun to show itself betwixt the Frenchand English, the Italians and the Germans, and even be-tween the Danes and Swedes; but it is only that which di-vided the two nations whom one island bred, and who seemedmore animated against each other for the very reason, thatour narrative is principally concerned with.Of all the English nobles who had followed their King toPalestine, De Vaux was most prejudiced against the Scottish.They were his near neighbours, with whom he had beenengaged during his whole life in private or public warfare,and on whom he had inflicted many calamities, while hehad sustained at their hands not a few. His love and devo-tion to the King was like the vivid affection of the old En-glish mastiff to his master, leaving him churlish and inacces-sible to all others even towards those to whom he was indif-ferent?and rough and dangerous to any against whom heentertained a prejudice. De Vaux had never observed with-out jealousy and displeasure his King exhibit any mark ofcourtesy or favour to the wicked, deceitful, and ferociousrace born on the other side of a river, or an imaginary linedrawn through waste and wilderness; and he even doubtedthe success of a Crusade in which they were suffered to beararms, holding them in his secret soul little better than theSaracens whom he came to combat. It may be added that, asbeing himself a blunt and downright Englishman, unaccus-tomed to conceal the slightest movement either of love or ofdislike, he accounted the fair-spoken courtesy which the Scotshad learned, either from imitation of their frequent allies, 88The Talismanthe French, or which might have arisen from their own proudand reserved character, as a false and astucious mark of themost dangerous designs against their neighbours, over whomhe believed, with genuine English confidence, they could,by fair manhood, never obtain any advantage.Yet, though De Vaux entertained these sentiments con-cerning his Northern neighbours, and extended them, withlittle mitigation, even to such as had assumed the Cross, hisrespect for the King, and a sense of the duty imposed by hisvow as a Crusader, prevented him from displaying them oth-erwise than by regularly shunning all intercourse with hisScottish brethren-at-arms as far as possible, by observing asullen taciturnity when compelled to meet them occasion-ally, and by looking scornfully upon them when they en-countered on the march and in camp. The Scottish baronsand knights were not men to bear his scorn unobserved orunreplied to; and it came to that pass that he was regarded asthe determined and active enemy of a nation, whom, afterall, he only disliked, and in some sort despised. Nay, it wasremarked by close observers that, if he had not towards themthe charity of Scripture, which suffereth long, and judgeskindly, he was by no means deficient in the subordinate andlimited virtue, which alleviates and relieves the wants of oth-ers. The wealth of Thomas of Gilsland procured supplies ofprovisions and medicines, and some of these usually flowedby secret channels into the quarters of the Scottish?his surlybenevolence proceeding on the principle that, next to a man?sfriend, his foe was of most importance to him, passing overall the intermediate relations as too indifferent to merit evena thought. This explanation is necessary, in order that thereader may fully understand what we are now to detail.Thomas de Vaux had not made many steps beyond theentrance of the royal pavilion when he was aware of whatthe far more acute ear of the English monarch?no meanproficient in the art of minstrelsy?had instantly discovered,that the musical strains, namely, which had reached theirears, were produced by the pipes, shalms, and kettle-drumsof the Saracens; and at the bottom of an avenue of tents,which formed a broad access to the pavilion of Richard, hecould see a crowd of idle soldiers assembled around the spotfrom which the music was heard, almost in the centre of thecamp; and he saw, with great surprise, mingled amid the 89Sir Walter Scotthelmets of various forms worn by the Crusaders of differentnations, white turbans and long pikes, announcing the pres-ence of armed Saracens, and the huge deformed heads ofseveral camels or dromedaries, overlooking the multitude byaid of their long, disproportioned necks.Wondering, and displeased at a sight so unexpected andsingular?for it was customary to leave all flags of truce andother communications from the enemy at an appointed placewithout the barriers?the baron looked eagerly round forsome one of whom he might inquire the cause of this alarm-ing novelty.The first person whom he met advancing to him he setdown at once, by his grave and haughty step, as a Spaniardor a Scot; and presently after muttered to himself, ?And aScot it is?he of the Leopard. I have seen him fight indiffer-ently well, for one of his country.?Loath to ask even a passing question, he was about to passSir Kenneth, with that sullen and lowering port which seemsto say, ?I know thee, but I will hold no communication withthee.? But his purpose was defeated by the Northern Knight,who moved forward directly to him, and accosting him withformal courtesy, said, ?My Lord de Vaux of Gilsland, I havein charge to speak with you.??Ha!? returned the English baron, ?with me? But say yourpleasure, so it be shortly spoken?I am on the King?s er-rand.??Mine touches King Richard yet more nearly,? answeredSir Kenneth; ?I bring him, I trust, health.?The Lord of Gilsland measured the Scot with incredulouseyes, and replied, ?Thou art no leech, I think, Sir Scot; I hadas soon thought of your bringing the King of Englandwealth.?Sir Kenneth, though displeased with the manner of thebaron?s reply, answered calmly, ?Health to Richard is gloryand wealth to Christendom.?But my time presses; I prayyou, may I see the King???Surely not, fair sir,? said the baron, ?until your errand betold more distinctly. The sick chambers of princes open notto all who inquire, like a northern hostelry.??My lord,? said Kenneth, ?the cross which I wear in com-mon with yourself, and the importance of what I have totell, must, for the present, cause me to pass over a bearing 90The Talismanwhich else I were unapt to endure. In plain language, then, Ibring with me a Moorish physician, who undertakes to worka cure on King Richard.??A Moorish physician!? said De Vaux; ?and who will war-rant that he brings not poisons instead of remedies???His own life, my lord?his head, which he offers as aguarantee.??I have known many a resolute ruffian,? said De Vaux,?who valued his own life as little as it deserved, and wouldtroop to the gallows as merrily as if the hangman were hispartner in a dance.??But thus it is, my lord,? replied the Scot. ?Saladin, towhom none will deny the credit of a generous and valiantenemy, hath sent this leech hither with an honourable reti-nue and guard, befitting the high estimation in which ElHakim [The Physician] is held by the Soldan, and with fruitsand refreshments for the King?s private chamber, and suchmessage as may pass betwixt honourable enemies, prayinghim to be recovered of his fever, that he may be the fitter toreceive a visit from the Soldan, with his naked scimitar in hishand, and a hundred thousand cavaliers at his back. Will itplease you, who are of the King?s secret council, to causethese camels to be discharged of their burdens, and someorder taken as to the reception of the learned physician???Wonderful!? said De Vaux, as speaking to himself.??Andwho will vouch for the honour of Saladin, in a case whenbad faith would rid him at once of his most powerful adver-sary???I myself,? replied Sir Kenneth, ?will be his guarantee, withhonour, life, and fortune.??Strange!? again ejaculated De Vaux; ?the North vouchesfor the South?the Scot for the Turk! May I crave of you, SirKnight, how you became concerned in this affair???I have been absent on a pilgrimage, in the course of which,?replied Sir Kenneth ?I had a message to discharge towardsthe holy hermit of Engaddi.??May I not be entrusted with it, Sir Kenneth, and with theanswer of the holy man???It may not be, my lord,? answered the Scot.?I am of the secret council of England,? said the English-man haughtily.?To which land I owe no allegiance,? said Kenneth. 91Sir Walter Scott?Though I have voluntarily followed in this war the per-sonal fortunes of England?s sovereign, I was dispatched bythe General Council of the kings, princes, and supreme lead-ers of the army of the Blessed Cross, and to them only Irender my errand.??Ha! sayest thou?? said the proud Baron de Vaux. ?Butknow, messenger of the kings and princes as thou mayest be,no leech shall approach the sick-bed of Richard of Englandwithout the consent of him of Gilsland; and they will comeon evil errand who dare to intrude themselves against it.?He was turning loftily away, when the Scot, placing him-self closer, and more opposite to him, asked, in a calm voice,yet not without expressing his share of pride, whether theLord of Gilsland esteemed him a gentleman and a goodknight.?All Scots are ennobled by their birthright,? answered Tho-mas de Vaux, something ironically; but sensible of his owninjustice, and perceiving that Kenneth?s colour rose, he added,?For a good knight it were sin to doubt you, in one at leastwho has seen you well and bravely discharge your devoir.??Well, then,? said the Scottish knight, satisfied with thefrankness of the last admission, ?and let me swear to you,Thomas of Gilsland, that, as I am true Scottish man, whichI hold a privilege equal to my ancient gentry, and as sure as Iam a belted knight, and come hither to acquire los [Los?laus, praise, or renown] and fame in this mortal life, andforgiveness of my sins in that which is to come?so truly,and by the blessed Cross which I wear, do I protest unto youthat I desire but the safety of Richard Coeur de Lion, inrecommending the ministry of this Moslem physician.?The Englishman was struck with the solemnity of the ob-testation, and answered with more cordiality than he hadyet exhibited, ?Tell me, Sir Knight of the Leopard, granting(which I do not doubt) that thou art thyself satisfied in thismatter, shall I do well, in a land where the art of poisoning isas general as that of cooking, to bring this unknown physi-cian to practise with his drugs on a health so valuable toChristendom???My lord,? replied the Scot, ?thus only can I reply?thatmy squire, the only one of my retinue whom war and diseasehad left in attendance on me, has been of late suffering dan-gerously under this same fever, which, in valiant King Rich- 92The Talismanard, has disabled the principal limb of our holy enterprise.This leech, this El Hakim, hath ministered remedies to himnot two hours since, and already he hath fallen into a re-freshing sleep. That he can cure the disorder, which has provedso fatal, I nothing doubt; that he hath the purpose to do it is,I think, warranted by his mission from the royal Soldan,who is true-hearted and loyal, so far as a blinded infidel maybe called so; and for his eventual success, the certainty ofreward in case of succeeding, and punishment in case of vol-untary failure, may be a sufficient guarantee.?The Englishman listened with downcast looks, as one whodoubted, yet was not unwilling to receive conviction. Atlength he looked up and said, ?May I see your sick squire,fair sir??The Scottish knight hesitated and coloured, yet answeredat last, ?Willingly, my Lord of Gilsland. But you must re-member, when you see my poor quarter, that the nobles andknights of Scotland feed not so high, sleep not so soft, andcare not for the magnificence of lodgment which is Properto their southern neighbours. I am poorly lodged, my Lordof Gilsland,? he added, with a haughty emphasis on the word,while, with some unwillingness, he led the way to his tem-porary place of abode.Whatever were the prejudices of De Vaux against the nationof his new acquaintance, and though we undertake not todeny that some of these were excited by its proverbial poverty,he had too much nobleness of disposition to enjoy the morti-fication of a brave individual thus compelled to make knownwants which his pride would gladly have concealed.?Shame to the soldier of the Cross,? he said, ?who thinksof worldly splendour, or of luxurious accommodation, whenpressing forward to the conquest of the Holy City. Fare ashard as we may, we shall yet be better than the host of mar-tyrs and of saints, who, having trod these scenes before us,now hold golden lamps and evergreen palms.?This was the most metaphorical speech which Thomas ofGilsland was ever known to utter, the rather, perhaps (as willsometimes happen), that it did not entirely express his ownsentiments, being somewhat a lover of good cheer and splen-did accommodation. By this time they reached the place ofthe camp where the Knight of the Leopard had assumed hisabode. 93Sir Walter ScottAppearances here did indeed promise no breach of the lawsof mortification, to which the Crusaders, according to theopinion expressed by him of Gilsland, ought to subject them-selves. A space of ground, large enough to accommodateperhaps thirty tents, according to the Crusaders? rules ofcastrametation, was partly vacant?because, in ostentation,the knight had demanded ground to the extent of his origi-nal retinue?partly occupied by a few miserable huts, hast-ily constructed of boughs, and covered with palm-leaves.These habitations seemed entirely deserted, and several ofthem were ruinous. The central hut, which represented thepavilion of the leader, was distinguished by his swallow-tailedpennon, placed on the point of a spear, from which its longfolds dropped motionless to the ground, as if sickening un-der the scorching rays of the Asiatic sun. But no pages orsquires?not even a solitary warder?was placed by the em-blem of feudal power and knightly degree. If its reputationdefended it not from insult, it had no other guard.Sir Kenneth cast a melancholy look around him, butsuppessing his feelings, entered the hut, making a sign to theBaron of Gilsland to follow. He also cast around a glance ofexamination, which implied pity not altogether unmingledwith contempt, to which, perhaps, it is as nearly akin as it issaid to be to love. He then stooped his lofty crest, and en-tered a lowly hut, which his bulky form seemed almost en-tirely to fill.The interior of the hut was chiefly occupied by two beds.One was empty, but composed of collected leaves, and spreadwith an antelope?s hide. It seemed, from the articles of armourlaid beside it, and from a crucifix of silver, carefully and rev-erentially disposed at the head, to be the couch of the knighthimself. The other contained the invalid, of whom Sir Ken-neth had spoken, a strong-built and harsh-featured man, past,as his looks betokened, the middle age of life. His couch wastrimmed more softly than his master?s, and it was plain thatthe more courtly garments of the latter, the loose robe inwhich the knights showed themselves on pacific occasions,and the other little spare articles of dress and adornment,had been applied by Sir Kenneth to the accommodation ofhis sick domestic. In an outward part of the hut, which yetwas within the range of the English baron?s eye, a boy, rudelyattired with buskins of deer?s hide, a blue cap or bonnet, and 94The Talismana doublet, whose original finery was much tarnished, sat onhis knees by a chafing-dish filled with charcoal, cooking upona plate of iron the cakes of barley-bread, which were then,and still are, a favourite food with the Scottish people. Partof an antelope was suspended against one of the main propsof the hut. Nor was it difficult to know how it had beenprocured; for a large stag greyhound, nobler in size and ap-pearance than those even which guarded King Richard?s sick-bed, lay eyeing the process of baking the cake. The sagaciousanimal, on their first entrance, uttered a stifled growl, whichsounded from his deep chest like distant thunder. But hesaw his master, and acknowledged his presence by wagginghis tail and couching his head, abstaining from more tumul-tuous or noisy greeting, as if his noble instinct had taughthim the propriety of silence in a sick man?s chamber.Beside the couch sat on a cushion, also composed of skins,the Moorish physician of whom Sir Kenneth had spoken,cross-legged, after the Eastern fashion. The imperfect lightshowed little of him, save that the lower part of his face wascovered with a long, black beard, which descended over hisbreast; that he wore a high tolpach, a Tartar cap of the lamb?swool manufactured at Astracan, bearing the same duskycolour; and that his ample caftan, or Turkish robe, was alsoof a dark hue. Two piercing eyes, which gleamed with un-usual lustre, were the only lineaments of his visage that couldbe discerned amid the darkness in which he was enveloped.The English lord stood silent with a sort of reverential awe;for notwithstanding the roughness of his general bearing, ascene of distress and poverty, firmly endured without com-plaint or murmur, would at any time have claimed morereverence from Thomas de Vaux than would all the splendidformalities of a royal presence-chamber, unless that presence-chamber were King Richard?s own. Nothing was for a timeheard but the heavy and regular breathings of the invalid,who seemed in profound repose.?He hath not slept for six nights before,? said Sir Kenneth,?as I am assured by the youth, his attendant.??Noble Scot,? said Thomas de Vaux, grasping the Scottishknight?s hand, with a pressure which had more of cordialitythan he permitted his words to utter, ?this gear must beamended. Your esquire is but too evil fed and looked to.?In the latter part of this speech he naturally raised his voice 95Sir Walter Scottto its usual decided tone, The sick man was disturbed in hisslumbers.?My master,? he said, murmuring as in a dream, ?noble SirKenneth, taste not, to you as to me, the waters of the Clydecold and refreshing after the brackish springs of Palestine???He dreams of his native land, and is happy in his slum-bers,? whispered Sir Kenneth to De Vaux; but had scarceuttered the words, when the physician, arising from the placewhich he had taken near the couch of the sick, and layingthe hand of the patient, whose pulse he had been carefullywatching, quietly upon the couch, came to the two knights,and taking them each by the arm, while he intimated to themto remain silent, led them to the front of the hut.?In the name of Issa Ben Mariam,? he said, ?whom wehonour as you, though not with the same blinded supersti-tion, disturb not the effect of the blessed medicine of whichhe hath partaken. To awaken him now is death or depriva-tion of reason; but return at the hour when the muezzin callsfrom the minaret to evening prayer in the mosque, and ifleft undisturbed until then, I promise you this same Frank-ish soldier shall be able, without prejudice to his health, tohold some brief converse with you on any matters on whicheither, and especially his master, may have to question him.?The knights retreated before the authoritative commandsof the leech, who seemed fully to comprehend the impor-tance of the Eastern proverb that the sick chamber of thepatient is the kingdom of the physician.They paused, and remained standing together at the doorof the hut?Sir Kenneth with the air of one who expectedhis visitor to say farewell, and De Vaux as if he had some-thing on his mind which prevented him from doing so. Thehound, however, had pressed out of the tent after them, andnow thrust his long, rough countenance into the hand of hismaster, as if modestly soliciting some mark of his kindness.He had no sooner received the notice which he desired, inthe shape of a kind word and slight caress, than, eager toacknowledge his gratitude and joy for his master?s return, heflew off at full speed, galloping in full career, and with out-stretched tail, here and there, about and around, cross-waysand endlong, through the decayed huts and the esplanadewe have described, but never transgressing those precinctswhich his sagacity knew were protected by his master?s pen- 96The Talismannon. After a few gambols of this kind, the dog, coming closeup to his master, laid at once aside his frolicsome mood,relapsed into his usual gravity and slowness of gesture anddeportment, and looked as if he were ashamed that anythingshould have moved him to depart so far out of his sober self-control.Both knights looked on with pleasure; for Sir Kenneth wasjustly proud of his noble hound, and the northern Englishbaron was, of course, an admirer of the chase, and a judge ofthe animal?s merits.?A right able dog,? he said. ?I think, fair sir, King Richardhath not an alan which may match him, if he be as stanch ashe is swift. But let me pray you?speaking in all honour andkindness?have you not heard the proclamation that no oneunder the rank of earl shall keep hunting dogs within KingRichard?s camp without the royal license, which, I think, SirKenneth, hath not been issued to you? I speak as Master ofthe Horse.??And I answer as a free Scottish knight,? said Kennethsternly. ?For the present I follow the banner of England, butI cannot remember that I have ever subjected myself to theforest-laws of that kingdom, nor have I such respect for themas would incline me to do so. When the trumpet sounds toarms, my foot is in the stirrup as soon as any?when it clangsfor the charge, my lance has not yet been the last laid in therest. But for my hours of liberty or of idleness King Richardhas no title to bar my recreation.??Nevertheless,? said De Vaux, ?it is a folly to disobey theKing?s ordinance; so, with your good leave, I, as having au-thority in that matter, will send you a protection for my friendhere.??I thank you,? said the Scot coldly; ?but he knows myallotted quarters, and within these I can protect him my-self.?And yet,? he said, suddenly changing his manner, ?thisis but a cold return for a well-meant kindness. I thank you,my lord, most heartily. The King?s equerries or prickers mightfind Roswal at disadvantage, and do him some injury, whichI should not, perhaps, be slow in returning, and so ill mightcome of it. You have seen so much of my house-keeping, mylord,? he added, with a smile, ?that I need not shame to saythat Roswal is our principal purveyor, and well I hope ourLion Richard will not be like the lion in the minstrel fable, 97Sir Walter Scottthat went a-hunting, and kept the whole booty to himself. Icannot think he would grudge a poor gentleman, who followshim faithfully, his hour of sport and his morsel of game, moreespecially when other food is hard enough to come by.??By my faith, you do the King no more than justice; andyet,? said the baron, ?there is something in these words, vertand venison, that turns the very brains of our Normanprinces.??We have heard of late,? said the Scot, ?by minstrels andpilgrims, that your outlawed yeomen have formed great bandsin the shires of York and Nottingham, having at their head amost stout archer, called Robin Hood, with his lieutenant,Little John. Methinks it were better that Richard relaxed hisforest-code in England, than endeavour to enforce it in theHoly Land.??Wild work, Sir Kenneth,? replied De Vaux, shrugging hisshoulders, as one who would avoid a perilous or unpleasingtopic??a mad world, sir. I must now bid you adieu, havingpresently to return to the King?s pavilion. At vespers I willagain, with your leave, visit your quarters, and speak withthis same infidel physician. I would, in the meantime, wereit no offence, willingly send you what would somewhat mendyour cheer.??I thank you, sir,? said Sir Kenneth, ?but it needs not.Roswal hath already stocked my larder for two weeks, sincethe sun of Palestine, if it brings diseases, serves also to dryvenison.?The two warriors parted much better friends than theyhad met; but ere they separated, Thomas de Vaux informedhimself at more length of the circumstances attending themission of the Eastern physician, and received from the Scot-tish knight the credentials which he had brought to KingRichard on the part of Saladin. 98The TalismanCHAPTER VIII.A wise physician, skilled our wounds to heal,Is more than armies to the common weal.Pope?s Illiad.?THIS IS A STRANGE TALE, Sir Thomas,? said the sick monarch,when he had heard the report of the trusty Baron of Gilsland.?Art thou sure this Scottish man is a tall man and true???I cannot say, my lord,? replied the jealous Borderer. ?Ilive a little too near the Scots to gather much truth amongthem, having found them ever fair and false. But this man?sbearing is that of a true man, were he a devil as well as a Scot;that I must needs say for him in conscience.??And for his carriage as a knight, how sayest thou, DeVaux?? demanded the King.?It is your Majesty?s business more than mine to note men?sbearings; and I warrant you have noted the manner in whichthis man of the Leopard hath borne himself. He hath beenfull well spoken of.??And justly, Thomas,? said the King. ?We have ourselveswitnessed him. It is indeed our purpose in placing ourselvesever in the front of battle, to see how our liegemen and fol-lowers acquit themselves, and not from a desire to accumu-late vainglory to ourselves, as some have supposed. We knowthe vanity of the praise of man, which is but a vapour, andbuckle on our armour for other purposes than to win it.?De Vaux was alarmed when he heard the King make adeclaration so inconsistent with his nature, and believed atfirst that nothing short of the approach of death could havebrought him to speak in depreciating terms of military re-nown, which was the very breath of his nostrils. But recol-lecting he had met the royal confessor in the outer pavilion,he was shrewd enough to place this temporary self-abase-ment to the effect of the reverend man?s lesson, and sufferedthe King to proceed without reply.?Yes,? continued Richard, ?I have indeed marked the man-ner in which this knight does his devoir. My leading-staffwere not worth a fool?s bauble had he escaped my notice;and he had ere now tasted of our bounty, but that I have alsomarked his overweening and audacious presumption.? 99Sir Walter Scott?My liege,? said the Baron of Gilsland, observing the King?scountenance change, ?I fear I have transgressed your plea-sure in lending some countenance to his transgression.??How, De Multon, thou?? said the King, contracting hisbrows, and speaking in a tone of angry surprise. ?Thou coun-tenance his insolence? It cannot be.??Nay, your Majesty will pardon me to remind you that Ihave by mine office right to grant liberty to men of gentleblood to keep them a hound or two within camp, just tocherish the noble art of venerie ; and besides, it were a sin tohave maimed or harmed a thing so noble as this gentleman?sdog.?Has he, then, a dog so handsome?? said the King.?A most perfect creature of Heaven,? said the baron, whowas an enthusiast in field-sports??of the noblest Northernbreed?deep in the chest, strong in the stern?black colour,and brindled on the breast and legs, not spotted with white,but just shaded into grey?strength to pull down a bull,swiftness to cote an antelope.?The King laughed at his enthusiasm. ?Well, thou hast givenhim leave to keep the hound, so there is an end of it. Be not,however, liberal of your licenses among those knights adven-turers who have no prince or leader to depend upon; theyare ungovernable, and leave no game in Palestine.?But tothis piece of learned heathenesse?sayest thou the Scot methim in the desert???No, my liege; the Scot?s tale runs thus. He was dispatchedto the old hermit of Engaddi, of whom men talk so much????Sdeath and hell!? said Richard, starting up. ?By whomdispatched, and for what? Who dared send any one thither,when our Queen was in the Convent of Engaddi, upon herpilgrimage for our recovery???The Council of the Crusade sent him, my lord,? answeredthe Baron de Vaux; ?for what purpose, he declined to ac-count to me. I think it is scarce known in the camp that yourroyal consort is on a pilgrimage; and even the princes maynot have been aware, as the Queen has been sequestered fromcompany since your love prohibited her attendance in caseof infection.??Well, it shall be looked into,? said Richard. ?So this Scot-tish man, this envoy, met with a wandering physician at thegrotto of Engaddi?ha?? 100The Talisman?Not so my liege,? replied De Vaux? ?but he met, I think,near that place, with a Saracen Emir with whom he had somemelee in the way of proof of valour, and finding him worthyto bear brave men company, they went together, as errantknights are wont, to the grotto of Engaddi.?Here De Vaux stopped, for he was not one of those whocan tell a long story in a sentence.?And did they there meet the physician?? demanded theKing impatiently.?No, my liege,? replied De Vaux; ?but the Saracen, learn-ing your Majesty?s grievous illness, undertook that Saladinshould send his own physician to you, and with many assur-ances of his eminent skill; and he came to the grotto accord-ingly, after the Scottish knight had tarried a day for him andmore. He is attended as if he were a prince, with drums andatabals, and servants on horse and foot, and brings with himletters of credence from Saladin.??Have they been examined by Giacomo Loredani???I showed them to the interpreter ere bringing them hither,and behold their contents in English.?Richard took a scroll, in which were inscribed these words:The blessing of Allah and his Prophet Mohammed [?Outupon the hound!? said Richard, spitting in contempt, byway of interjection], Saladin, king of kings, Saldan of Egyptand of Syria, the light and refuge of the earth, to the greatMelech Ric, Richard of England, greeting. Whereas, we havebeen informed that the hand of sickness hath been heavyupon thee, our royal brother, and that thou hast with theeonly such Nazarene and Jewish mediciners as work withoutthe blessing of Allah and our holy Prophet [?Confusion onhis head!? again muttered the English monarch], we havetherefore sent to tend and wait upon thee at this time thephysician to our own person, Adonbec el Hakim, beforewhose face the angel Azrael [The Angel of Death.] spreadshis wings and departs from the sick chamber; who knowsthe virtues of herbs and stones, the path of the sun, moon,and stars, and can save man from all that is not written onhis forehead. And this we do, praying you heartily to honourand make use of his skill; not only that we may do service tothy worth and valour, which is the glory of all the nations ofFrangistan, but that we may bring the controversy which isat present between us to an end, either by honourable agree- 101Sir Walter Scottment, or by open trial thereof with our weapons, in a fairfield?seeing that it neither becomes thy place and courageto die the death of a slave who hath been overwrought by histaskmaster, nor befits it our fame that a brave adversary besnatched from our weapon by such a disease. And, there-fore, may the holy???Hold, hold,? said Richard, ? I will have no more of hisdog of a prophet! It makes me sick to think the valiant andworthy Soldan should believe in a dead dog. Yes, I will seehis physician. I will put myself into the charge of thisHakim?I will repay the noble Soldan his generosity?I willmeet Saladin in the field, as he so worthily proposes, and heshall have no cause to term Richard of England ungrateful. Iwill strike him to the earth with my battle-axe?I will con-vert him to Holy Church with such blows as he has rarelyendured. He shall recant his errors before my good cross-handled sword, and I will have him baptized on the battle-field, from my own helmet, though the cleansing waters weremixed with the blood of us both.?Haste, De Vaux, whydost thou delay a conclusion so pleasing? Fetch the Hakimhither.??My lord,? said the baron, who perhaps saw some acces-sion of fever in this overflow of confidence, ?bethink you,the Soldan is a pagan, and that you are his most formidableenemy???For which reason he is the more bound to do me servicein this matter, lest a paltry fever end the quarrel betwixt twosuch kings. I tell thee he loves me as I love him?as nobleadversaries ever love each other. By my honour, it were sin todoubt his good faith!??Nevertheless, my lord, it were well to wait the issue ofthese medicines upon the Scottish squire,? said the Lord ofGilsland. ?My own life depends upon it, for worthy were Ito die like a dog did I proceed rashly in this matter, andmake shipwreck of the weal of Christendom.??I never knew thee before hesitate for fear of life,? saidRichard upbraidingly.?Nor would I now, my liege,? replied the stout-heartedbaron, ?save that yours lies at pledge as well as my own.??Well, thou suspicious mortal,? answered Richard, ?be-gone then, and watch the progress of this remedy. I couldalmost wish it might either cure or kill me, for I am weary of 102The Talismanlying here like an ox dying of the murrain, when tamboursare beating, horses stamping, and trumpets sounding with-out.?The baron hastily departed, resolved, however, to com-municate his errand to some churchman, as he felt some-thing burdened in conscience at the idea of his master beingattended by an unbeliever.The Archbishop of Tyre was the first to whom he confidedhis doubts, knowing his interest with his master, Richard,who both loved and honoured that sagacious prelate. Thebishop heard the doubts which De Vaux stated, with thatacuteness of intelligence which distinguishes the RomanCatholic clergy. The religious scruples of De Vaux he treatedwith as much lightness as propriety permitted him to exhibiton such a subject to a layman.?Mediciners,? he said, ?like the medicines which theyemployed, were often useful, though the one were by birthor manners the vilest of humanity, as the others are, in manycases, extracted from the basest materials. Men may use theassistance of pagans and infidels,? he continued, ?in theirneed, and there is reason to think that one cause of theirbeing permitted to remain on earth is that they might min-ister to the convenience of true Christians. Thus we lawfullymake slaves of heathen captives. Again,? proceeded the prel-ate, ?there is no doubt that the primitive Christians used theservices of the unconverted heathen. Thus in the ship of Al-exandria, in which the blessed Apostle Paul sailed to Italy,the sailors were doubtless pagans; yet what said the holy saintwhen their ministry was needful? ? ?Nisi hi in navi manserint,vos salvi fieri non potestis?? Unless these men abide in theship, ye cannot be saved. Again, Jews are infidels to Chris-tianity, as well as Mohammedans. But there are few physi-cians in the camp excepting Jews, and such are employedwithout scandal or scruple. Therefore, Mohammedans maybe used for their service in that capacity?quod eratdemonstrandum.?This reasoning entirely removed the scruples of Thomasde Vaux, who was particularly moved by the Latin quota-tion, as he did not understand a word of it.But the bishop proceeded with far less fluency when heconsidered the possibility of the Saracen?s acting with badfaith; and here he came not to a speedy decision. The baron 103Sir Walter Scottshowed him the letters of credence. He read and re-read them,and compared the original with the translation.?It is a dish choicely cooked,? he said, ?to the palate ofKing Richard, and I cannot but have my suspicions of thewily Saracen. They are curious in the art of poisons, and canso temper them that they shall be weeks in acting upon theparty, during which time the perpetrator has leisure to es-cape. They can impregnate cloth and leather, nay, even pa-per and parchment, with the most subtle venom. Our Ladyforgive me! And wherefore, knowing this, hold I these lettersof credence so close to my face? Take them, Sir Thomas?take them speedily!?Here he gave them at arm?s-length, and with some appear-ance of haste, to the baron. ?But come, my Lord de Vaux,?he continued, ?wend we to the tent of this sick squire, wherewe shall learn whether this Hakim hath really the art of cur-ing which he professeth, ere we consider whether there besafety in permitting him to exercise his art upon King Rich-ard.?Yet, hold! let me first take my pouncet-box, for thesefevers spread like an infection. I would advise you to usedried rosemary steeped in vinegar, my lord. I, too, knowsomething of the healing art.??I thank your reverend lordship,? replied Thomas ofGilsland; ?but had I been accessible to the fever, I had caughtit long since by the bed of my master.?The Bishop of Tyre blushed, for he had rather avoided thepresence of the sick monarch; and he bid the baron lead on.As they paused before the wretched hut in which Kennethof the Leopard and his follower abode, the bishop said to DeVaux, ?Now, of a surety, my lord, these Scottish Knightshave worse care of their followers than we of our dogs. Hereis a knight, valiant, they say, in battle, and thought fitting tobe graced with charges of weight in time of truce, whoseesquire of the body is lodged worse than in the worst dog-kennel in England. What say you of your neighbours???That a master doth well enough for his servant when helodgeth him in no worse dwelling than his own,? said DeVaux, and entered the hut.The bishop followed, not without evident reluctance; forthough he lacked not courage in some respects, yet it wastempered with a strong and lively regard for his own safety.He recollected, however, the necessity there was for judging 104The Talismanpersonally of the skill of the Arabian physician, and enteredthe hut with a stateliness of manner calculated, as he thought,to impose respect on the stranger.The prelate was, indeed, a striking and commanding fig-ure. In his youth he had been eminently handsome, and evenin age was unwilling to appear less so. His episcopal dresswas of the richest fashion, trimmed with costly fur, and sur-rounded by a cope of curious needlework. The rings on hisfingers were worth a goodly barony, and the hood which hewore, though now unclasped and thrown back for heat, hadstuds of pure gold to fasten it around his throat and underhis chin when he so inclined. His long beard, now silveredwith age, descended over his breast. One of two youthfulacolytes who attended him created an artificial shade, pecu-liar then to the East, by bearing over his head an umbrella ofpalmetto leaves, while the other refreshed his reverend mas-ter by agitating a fan of peacock-feathers.When the Bishop of Tyre entered the hut of the Scottishknight, the master was absent, and the Moorish physician,whom he had come to see, sat in the very posture in whichDe Vaux had left him several hours before, cross-legged upona mat made of twisted leaves, by the side of the patient, whoappeared in deep slumber, and whose pulse he felt from timeto time. The bishop remained standing before him in silencefor two or three minutes, as if expecting some honourablesalutation, or at least that the Saracen would seem struckwith the dignity of his appearance. But Adonbec el Hakimtook no notice of him beyond a passing glance, and whenthe prelate at length saluted him in the lingua franca currentin the country, he only replied by the ordinary Oriental greet-ing, ?Salam alicum?Peace be with you.??Art thou a physician, infidel?? said the bishop, somewhatmortified at this cold reception. ?I would speak with thee onthat art.??If thou knewest aught of medicine,? answered El Hakim,?thou wouldst be aware that physicians hold no counsel ordebate in the sick chamber of their patient. Hear,? he added,as the low growling of the staghound was heard from theinner hut, ?even the dog might teach thee reason, Ulemat.His instinct teaches him to suppress his barking in the sickman?s hearing. Come without the tent,? said he, rising andleading the way, ?if thou hast ought to say with me.? 105Sir Walter ScottNotwithstanding the plainness of the Saracen leech?s dress,and his inferiority of size when contrasted with the tall prel-ate and gigantic English baron, there was something strikingin his manner and countenance, which prevented the Bishopof Tyre from expressing strongly the displeasure he felt atthis unceremonious rebuke. When without the hut, he gazedupon Adonbec in silence for several minutes before he couldfix on the best manner to renew the conversation. No lockswere seen under the high bonnet of the Arabian, which hidalso part of a brow that seemed lofty and expanded, smooth,and free from wrinkles, as were his cheeks, where they wereseen under the shade of his long beard. We have elsewherenoticed the piercing quality of his dark eyes.The prelate, struck with his apparent youth, at length brokea pause, which the other seemed in no haste to interrupt, bydemanding of the Arabian how old he was??The years of ordinary men,? said the Saracen, ?are countedby their wrinkles; those of sages by their studies. I dare notcall myself older than a hundred revolutions of the Hegira.?[Meaning that his attainments were those which might havebeen made in a hundred years.]The Baron of Gilsland, who took this for a literal assertionthat he was a century old, looked doubtfully upon the prel-ate, who, though he better understood the meaning of ElHakim, answered his glance by mysteriously shaking his head.He resumed an air of importance when he again authorita-tively demanded what evidence Adonbec could produce ofhis medical proficiency.?Ye have the word of the mighty Saladin,? said the sage,touching his cap in sign of reverence??a word which wasnever broken towards friend or foe. What, Nazarene, wouldstthou demand more???I would have ocular proof of thy skill,? said the baron,?and without it thou approachest not to the couch of KingRichard.??The praise of the physician,? said the Arabian, ?is in therecovery of his patient. Behold this sergeant, whose bloodhas been dried up by the fever which has whitened your campwith skeletons, and against which the art of Your Nazareneleeches hath been like a silken doublet against a lance of steel.Look at his fingers and arms, wasted like the claws and shanksof the crane. Death had this morning his clutch on him; but 106The Talismanhad Azrael been on one side of the couch, I being on theother, his soul should not have been left from his body. Dis-turb me not with further questions, but await the criticalminute, and behold in silent wonder the marvellous event.?The physician had then recourse to his astrolabe, the oracleof Eastern science, and watching with grave precision untilthe precise time of the evening prayer had arrived, he sunkon his knees, with his face turned to Mecca, and recited thepetitions which close the Moslemah?s day of toil. The bishopand the English baron looked on each other, meanwhile,with symptoms of contempt and indignation, but neitherjudged it fit to interrupt El Hakim in his devotions, unholyas they considered them to be.The Arab arose from the earth, on which he had pros-trated himself, and walking into the hut where the patientlay extended, he drew a sponge from a small silver box, dippedperhaps in some aromatic distillation, for when he put it tothe sleeper?s nose, he sneezed, awoke, and looked wildlyaround. He was a ghastly spectacle as he sat up almost nakedon his couch, the bones and cartilages as visible through thesurface of his skin as if they had never been clothed withflesh. His face was long, and furrowed with wrinkles; but hiseye, though it wandered at first, became gradually moresettled. He seemed to be aware of the presence of his digni-fied visitors, for he attempted feebly to pull the covering fromhis head in token of reverence, as he inquired, in a subduedand submissive voice, for his master.?Do you know us, vassal?? said the Lord of Gilsland.?Not perfectly, my lord,? replied the squire faintly. ?Mysleep has been long and full of dreams. Yet I know that youare a great English lord, as seemeth by the red cross, and thisa holy prelate, whose blessing I crave on me a poor sinner.??Thou hast it?benedictio domini mini sit vobiscum,? saidthe prelate, making the sign of the cross, but without ap-proaching nearer to the patient?s bed.?Your eyes witness,? said the Arabian, ?the fever hath beensubdued. He speaks with calmness and recollection?hispulse beats composedly as yours?try its pulsations your-self?The prelate declined the experiment; but Thomas ofGilsland, more determined on making the trial, did so, andsatisfied himself that the fever was indeed gone. 107Sir Walter Scott?This is most wonderful,? said the knight, looking to thebishop; ?the man is assuredly cured. I must conduct thismediciner presently to King Richard?s tent. What thinks yourreverence???Stay, let me finish one cure ere I commence another,?said the Arab; ?I will pass with you when I have given mypatient the second cup of this most holy elixir.?So saying he pulled out a silver cup, and filling it withwater from a gourd which stood by the bedside, he next drewforth a small silken bag made of network, twisted with silver,the contents of which the bystanders could not discover, andimmersing it in the cup, continued to watch it in silenceduring the space of five minutes. It seemed to the spectatorsas if some effervescence took place during the operation; butif so, it instantly subsided.?Drink,? said the physician to the sick man??sleep, andawaken free from malady.??And with this simple-seeming draught thou wilt under-take to cure a monarch?? said the Bishop of Tyre.?I have cured a beggar, as you may behold,? replied thesage. ?Are the Kings of Frangistan made of other clay thanthe meanest of their subjects???Let us have him presently to the King,? said the Baron ofGilsland. ?He hath shown that he possesses the secret whichmay restore his health. If he fails to exercise it, I will puthimself past the power of medicine.?As they were about to leave the hut, the sick man, raisinghis voice as much as his weakness permitted, exclaimed, ?Rev-erend father, noble knight, and you, kind leech, if you wouldhave me sleep and recover, tell me in charity what is becomeof my dear master???He is upon a distant expedition, friend,? replied the prel-ate??on an honourable embassy, which may detain him forsome days.??Nay,? said the Baron of Gilsland, ?why deceive the poorfellow??Friend, thy master has returned to the camp, andyou will presently see him.?The invalid held up, as if in thankfulness, his wasted handsto Heaven, and resisting no longer the soporiferous opera-tion of the elixir, sunk down in a gentle sleep.?You are a better physician than I, Sir Thomas,? said theprelate? ?a soothing falsehood is fitter for a sick-room than 108The Talismanan unpleasing truth.??How mean you, my reverend lord?? said De Vaux hastily.?Think you I would tell a falsehood to save the lives of adozen such as he???You said,? replied the bishop, with manifest symptoms ofalarm? ?you said the esquire?s master was returned?he, Imean, of the Couchant Leopard.??And he IS returned,? said De Vaux. ?I spoke with himbut a few hours since. This learned leech came in his com-pany.??Holy Virgin! why told you not of his return to me?? saidthe bishop, in evident perturbation.?Did I not say that this same Knight of the Leopard hadreturned in company with the physician? I thought I had,?replied De Vaux carelessly. ?But what signified his return tothe skill of the physician, or the cure of his Majesty???Much, Sir Thomas?it signified much,? said the bishop,clenching his hands, pressing his foot against the earth, andgiving signs of impatience, as if in an involuntary manner.?But where can he be gone now, this same knight? God bewith us?here may be some fatal errors!??Yonder serf in the outer space,? said De Vaux, not with-out wonder at the bishop?s emotion, ?can probably tell uswhither his master has gone.?The lad was summoned, and in a language nearly incom-prehensible to them, gave them at length to understand thatan officer had summoned his master to the royal tent sometime before their arrival at that of his master. The anxiety ofthe bishop appeared to rise to the highest, and became evidentto De Vaux, though, neither an acute observer nor of a suspi-cious temper. But with his anxiety seemed to increase his wishto keep it subdued and unobserved. He took a hasty leave ofDe Vaux, who looked after him with astonishment, and aftershrugging his shoulders in silent wonder, proceeded to con-duct the Arabian physician to the tent of King Richard. 109Sir Walter ScottCHAPTER IX.This is the prince of leeches; fever, plague,Cold rheum, and hot podagra, do but look on him,And quit their grasp upon the tortured sinews.Anonymous.THE BARON OF GILSLAND walked with slow step and an anx-ious countenance towards the royal pavilion. He had muchdiffidence of his own capacity, except in a field of battle, andconscious of no very acute intellect, was usually contentedto wonder at circumstances which a man of livelier imagina-tion would have endeavoured to investigate and understand,or at least would have made the subject of speculation. But itseemed very extraordinary, even to him, that the attentionof the bishop should have been at once abstracted from allreflection on the marvellous cure which they had witnessed,and upon the probability it afforded of Richard being re-stored to health, by what seemed a very trivial piece of infor-mation announcing the motions of a beggardly Scottishknight, than whom Thomas of Gilsland knew nothing withinthe circle of gentle blood more unimportant or contempt-ible; and despite his usual habit of passively beholding pass-ing events, the baron?s spirit toiled with unwonted attemptsto form conjectures on the cause.At length the idea occurred at once to him that the wholemight be a conspiracy against King Richard, formed withinthe camp of the allies, and to which the bishop, who was bysome represented as a politic and unscrupulous person, wasnot unlikely to have been accessory. It was true that, in hisown opinion, there existed no character so perfect as that ofhis master; for Richard being the flower of chivalry, and thechief of Christian leaders, and obeying in all points the com-mands of Holy Church, De Vaux?s ideas of perfection went nofurther. Still, he knew that, however unworthily, it had beenalways his master?s fate to draw as much reproach and dislikeas honour and attachment from the display of his great quali-ties; and that in the very camp, and amongst those princesbound by oath to the Crusade, were many who would havesacrificed all hope of victory over the Saracens to the pleasureof ruining, or at least of humbling, Richard of England. 110The Talisman?Wherefore,? said the baron to himself, ?it is in no senseimpossible that this El Hakim, with this his cure, or seemingcure, wrought on the body of the Scottish squire, may meannothing but a trick, to which he of the Leopard may be ac-cessory, and wherein the Bishop of Tyre, prelate as he is, mayhave some share.?This hypothesis, indeed, could not be so easily reconciledwith the alarm manifested by the bishop on learning that,contrary to his expectation, the Scottish knight had suddenlyreturned to the Crusaders? camp. But De Vaux was influ-enced only by his general prejudices, which dictated to himthe assured belief that a wily Italian priest, a false-heartedScot, and an infidel physician, formed a set of ingredientsfrom which all evil, and no good, was likely to be extracted.He resolved, however, to lay his scruples bluntly before theKing, of whose judgment he had nearly as high an opinionas of his valour.Meantime, events had taken place very contrary to the sup-positions which Thomas de Vaux had entertained. Scarcehad he left the royal pavilion, when, betwixt the impatienceof the fever, and that which was natural to his disposition,Richard began to murmur at his delay, and express an ear-nest desire for his return. He had seen enough to try to rea-son himself out of this irritation, which greatly increased hisbodily malady. He wearied his attendants by demanding fromthem amusements, and the breviary of the priest, the ro-mance of the clerk, even the harp of his favourite minstrel,were had recourse to in vain. At length, some two hours be-fore sundown, and long, therefore, ere he could expect a sat-isfactory account of the process of the cure which the Mooror Arabian had undertaken, he sent, as we have already heard,a messenger commanding the attendance of the Knight ofthe Leopard, determined to soothe his impatience by ob-taining from Sir Kenneth a more particular account of thecause of his absence from the camp, and the circumstancesof his meeting with this celebrated physician.The Scottish knight, thus summoned, entered the royalpresence as one who was no stranger to such scenes. He wasscarcely known to the King of England, even by sight, al-though, tenacious of his rank, as devout in the adoration ofthe lady of his secret heart, he had never been absent onthose occasions when the munificence and hospitality of 111Sir Walter ScottEngland opened the Court of its monarch to all who held acertain rank in chivalry. The King gazed fixedly on Sir Ken-neth approaching his bedside, while the knight bent his kneefor a moment, then arose, and stood before him in a postureof deference, but not of subservience or humility, as becamean officer in the presence of his sovereign.?Thy name,? said the King, ?is Kenneth of the Leopard?from whom hadst thou degree of knighthood???I took it from the sword of William the Lion, King ofScotland,? replied the Scot.?A weapon,? said the King, ?well worthy to confer honour;nor has it been laid on an undeserving shoulder. We haveseen thee bear thyself knightly and valiantly in press of battle,when most need there was; and thou hadst not been yet tolearn that thy deserts were known to us, but that thy pre-sumption in other points has been such that thy services canchallenge no better reward than that of pardon for thy trans-gression. What sayest thou?ha??Kenneth attempted to speak, but was unable to expresshimself distinctly; the consciousness of his too ambitious love,and the keen, falcon glance with which Coeur de Lion seemedto penetrate his inmost soul, combining to disconcert him.?And yet,? said the King, ?although soldiers should obeycommand, and vassals be respectful towards their superiors,we might forgive a brave knight greater offence than the keep-ing a simple hound, though it were contrary to our expresspublic ordinance.?Richard kept his eye fixed on the Scot?s face, beheld andbeholding, smiling inwardly at the relief produced by theturn he had given to his general accusation.?So please you, my lord,? said the Scot, ?your majesty mustbe good to us poor gentlemen of Scotland in this matter. Weare far from home, scant of revenues, and cannot supportourselves as your wealthy nobles, who have credit of theLombards. The Saracens shall feel our blows the harder thatwe eat a piece of dried venison from time to time with ourherbs and barley-cakes.??It skills not asking my leave,? said Richard, ?since Tho-mas de Vaux, who doth, like all around me, that which isfittest in his own eyes, hath already given thee permissionfor hunting and hawking.??For hunting only, and please you,? said the Scot. ?But if 112The Talismanit please your Majesty to indulge me with the privilege ofhawking also, and you list to trust me with a falcon on fist, Itrust I could supply your royal mess with some choice water-fowl.??I dread me, if thou hadst but the falcon,? said the King,?thou wouldst scarce wait for the permission. I wot well it issaid abroad that we of the line of Anjou resent offence againstour forest-laws as highly as we would do treason against ourcrown. To brave and worthy men, however, we could par-don either misdemeanour.?But enough of this. I desire toknow of you, Sir Knight, wherefore, and by whose author-ity, you took this recent journey to the wilderness of the DeadSea and Engaddi???By order,? replied the knight, ?of the Council of Princesof the Holy Crusade.??And how dared any one to give such an order, when I?notthe least, surely, in the league?was unacquainted with it???It was not my part, please your highness,? said the Scot,?to inquire into such particulars. I am a soldier of the Cross?serving, doubtless, for the present, under your highness?sbanner, and proud of the permission to do so, but still onewho hath taken on him the holy symbol for the rights ofChristianity and the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre, andbound, therefore, to obey without question the orders of theprinces and chiefs by whom the blessed enterprise is directed.That indisposition should seclude, I trust for but a shorttime, your highness from their councils, in which you holdso potential a voice, I must lament with all Christendom;but, as a soldier, I must obey those on whom the lawful rightof command devolves, or set but an evil example in the Chris-tian camp.??Thou sayest well,? said King Richard; ?and the blame restsnot with thee, but with those with whom, when it shall pleaseHeaven to raise me from this accursed bed of pain and inac-tivity, I hope to reckon roundly. What was the purport ofthy message??Methinks, and please your highness,? replied Sir Kenneth,?that were best asked of those who sent me, and who canrender the reasons of mine errand; whereas I can only tell itsoutward form and purport.??Palter not with me, Sir Scot?it were ill for thy safety,?said the irritable monarch. 113Sir Walter Scott?My safety, my lord,? replied the knight firmly, ?I cast be-hind me as a regardless thing when I vowed myself to thisenterprise, looking rather to my immortal welfare than tothat which concerns my earthly body.??By the mass,? said King Richard, ?thou art a brave fellow!Hark thee, Sir Knight, I love the Scottish people; they arehardy, though dogged and stubborn, and, I think, true menin the main, though the necessity of state has sometimesconstrained them to be dissemblers. I deserve some love attheir hand, for I have voluntarily done what they could notby arms have extorted from me any more than from my pre-decessors, I have re-established the fortresses of Roxburghand Berwick, which lay in pledge to England; I have restoredyour ancient boundaries; and, finally, I have renounced aclaim to homage upon the crown of England, which I thoughtunjustly forced on you. I have endeavoured to makehonourable and independent friends, where former kings ofEngland attempted only to compel unwilling and rebelliousvassals.??All this you have done, my Lord King,? said Sir Kenneth,bowing ??all this you have done, by your royal treaty withour sovereign at Canterbury. Therefore have you me, andmany better Scottish men, making war against the infidels,under your banners, who would else have been ravaging yourfrontiers in England. If their numbers are now few, it is be-cause their lives have been freely waged and wasted.??I grant it true,? said the King; ?and for the good offices Ihave done your land I require you to remember that, as aprincipal member of the Christian league, I have a right toknow the negotiations of my confederates. Do me, there-fore, the justice to tell me what I have a title to be acquaintedwith, and which I am certain to know more truly from youthan from others.??My lord,? said the Scot, ?thus conjured, I will speak thetruth; for I well believe that your purposes towards the prin-cipal object of our expedition are single-hearted and honest,and it is more than I dare warrant for others of the HolyLeague. Be pleased, therefore, to know my charge was topropose, through the medium of the hermit of Engaddi?aholy man, respected and protected by Saladin himself???A continuation of the truce, I doubt not,? said Richard,hastily interrupting him. 114The Talisman?No, by Saint Andrew, my liege,? said the Scottish knight;?but the establishment of a lasting peace, and the withdraw-ing our armies from Palestine.??Saint George!? said Richard, in astonishment. ?Ill as Ihave justly thought of them, I could not have dreamed theywould have humbled themselves to such dishonour. Speak,Sir Kenneth, with what will did you carry such a message???With right good will, my lord,? said Kenneth; ?because,when we had lost our noble leader, under whose guidancealone I hoped for victory, I saw none who could succeed himlikely to lead us to conquest, and I accounted it well in suchcircumstances to avoid defeat.??And on what conditions was this hopeful peace to be con-tracted?? said King Richard, painfully suppressing the pas-sion with which his heart was almost bursting.?These were not entrusted to me, my lord,? answered theKnight of the Couchant Leopard. ?I delivered them sealedto the hermit.??And for what hold you this reverend hermit?for fool,madman, traitor, or saint?? said Richard.?His folly, sire,? replied the shrewd Scottish man, ?I holdto be assumed to win favour and reverence from thePaynimrie, who regard madmen as the inspired of Heaven?at least it seemed to me as exhibited only occasionally, andnot as mixing, like natural folly, with the general tenor of hismind.??Shrewdly replied,? said the monarch, throwing himselfback on his couch, from which he had half-raised himself.?Now of his penitence???His penitence,? continued Kenneth, ?appears to me sin-cere, and the fruits of remorse for some dreadful crime, forwhich he seems, in his own opinion, condemned to repro-bation.??And for his policy?? said King Richard.?Methinks, my lord,? said the Scottish knight, ?he despairsof the security of Palestine, as of his own salvation, by anymeans short of a miracle?at least, since the arm of Richardof England hath ceased to strike for it.??And, therefore, the coward policy of this hermit is likethat of these miserable princes, who, forgetful of their knight-hood and their faith, are only resolved and determined whenthe question is retreat, and rather than go forward against an 115Sir Walter Scottarmed Saracen, would trample in their flight over a dyingally!??Might I so far presume, my Lord King,? said the Scottishknight, ?this discourse but heats your disease, the enemy fromwhich Christendom dreads more evil than from armed hostsof infidels.?The countenance of King Richard was, indeed, moreflushed, and his action became more feverishly vehement,as, with clenched hand, extended arm, and flashing eyes, heseemed at once to suffer under bodily pain, and at the sametime under vexation of mind, while his high spirit led him tospeak on, as if in contempt of both.?You can flatter, Sir Knight,? he said, ?but you escape menot. I must know more from you than you have yet told me.Saw you my royal consort when at Engaddi???To my knowledge?no, my lord,? replied Sir Kenneth,with considerable perturbation, for he remembered the mid-night procession in the chapel of the rocks.?I ask you,? said the King, in a sterner voice,? whether youwere not in the chapel of the Carmelite nuns at Engaddi,and there saw Berengaria, Queen of England, and the ladiesof her Court, who went thither on pilgrimage???My lord,? said Sir Kenneth, ?I will speak the truth as inthe confessional. In a subterranean chapel, to which the an-chorite conducted me, I beheld a choir of ladies do homageto a relic of the highest sanctity; but as I saw not their faces,nor heard their voices, unless in the hymns which theychanted, I cannot tell whether the Queen of England was ofthe bevy.??And was there no one of these ladies known to you??Sir Kenneth stood silent.?I ask you,? said Richard, raising himself on his elbow, ?asa knight and a gentleman?and I shall know by your answerhow you value either character?did you, or did you not,know any lady amongst that band of worshippers???My lord,? said Kenneth, not without much hesitation, ?Imight guess.??And I also may guess,? said the King, frowning sternly;?but it is enough. Leopard as you are, Sir Knight, bewaretempting the lion?s paw. Hark ye?to become enamoured ofthe moon would be but an act of folly; but to leap from thebattlements of a lofty tower, in the wild hope of coming 116The Talismanwithin her sphere, were self-destructive madness.?At this moment some bustling was heard in the outer apart-ment, and the King, hastily changing to his more naturalmanner, said, ?Enough?begone?speed to De Vaux, andsend him hither with the Arabian physician. My life for thefaith of the Soldan! Would he but abjure his false law, I wouldaid him with my sword to drive this scum of French andAustrians from his dominions, and think Palestine as wellruled by him as when her kings were anointed by the decreeof Heaven itself.?The Knight of the Leopard retired, and presently after-wards the chamberlain announced a deputation From theCouncil, who had come to wait on the Majesty of England.?It is well they allow that I am living yet,? was his reply.?Who are the reverend ambassadors???The Grand Master of the Templars and the Marquis ofMontserrat.??Our brother of France loves not sick-beds,? said Richard;?yet, had Philip been ill, I had stood by his couch long since.?Jocelyn, lay me the couch more fairly?it is tumbled likea stormy sea. Reach me yonder steel mirror?pass a combthrough my hair and beard. They look, indeed, liker a lion?smane than a Christian man?s locks. Bring water.??My lord,? said the trembling chamberlain, ?the leechessay that cold water may be fatal.??To the foul fiend with the leeches!? replied the monarch;?if they cannot cure me, think you I will allow them to tor-ment me??There, then,? he said, after having made his ab-lutions, ?admit the worshipful envoys; they will now, I think,scarcely see that disease has made Richard negligent of hisperson.?The celebrated Master of the Templars was a tall, thin,war-worn man, with a slow yet penetrating eye, and a browon which a thousand dark intrigues had stamped a portionof their obscurity. At the head of that singular body, to whomtheir order was everything, and their individuality nothing?seeking the advancement of its power, even at the hazard ofthat very religion which the fraternity were originally associ-ated to protect?accused of heresy and witchcraft, althoughby their character Christian priests?suspected of secretleague with the Soldan, though by oath devoted to the pro-tection of the Holy Temple, or its recovery?the whole or- 117Sir Walter Scottder, and the whole personal character of its commander, orGrand Master, was a riddle, at the exposition of which mostmen shuddered. The Grand Master was dressed in his whiterobes of solemnity, and he bore the Abacus, a mystic staff ofoffice, the peculiar form of which has given rise to such sin-gular conjectures and commentaries, leading to suspicionsthat this celebrated fraternity of Christian knights were em-bodied under the foulest symbols of paganism.Conrade of Montserrat had a much more pleasing exteriorthan the dark and mysterious priest-soldier by whom he wasaccompanied. He was a handsome man, of middle age, orsomething past that term, bold in the field, sagacious in coun-cil, gay and gallant in times of festivity; but, on the otherhand, he was generally accused of versatility, of a narrow andselfish ambition, of a desire to extend his own principality,without regard to the weal of the Latin kingdom of Pales-tine, and of seeking his own interest, by private negotiationswith Saladin, to the prejudice of the Christian leaguers.When the usual salutations had been made by these digni-taries, and courteously returned by King Richard, the Mar-quis of Montserrat commenced an explanation of the mo-tives of their visit, sent, as he said they were, by the anxiouskings and princes who composed the Council of the Cru-saders, ?to inquire into the health of their magnanimous ally,the valiant King of England.??We know the importance in which the princes of theCouncil hold our health,? replied the English King; ?and arewell aware how much they must have suffered by suppress-ing all curiosity concerning it for fourteen days, for fear,doubtless, of aggravating our disorder, by showing their anxi-ety regarding the event.?The flow of the Marquis?s eloquence being checked, andhe himself thrown into some confusion by this reply, hismore austere companion took up the thread of the conversa-tion, and with as much dry and brief gravity as was consis-tent with the presence which he addressed, informed the Kingthat they came from the Council, to pray, in the name ofChristendom, ?that he would not suffer his health to be tam-pered with by an infidel physician, said to be dispatched bySaladin, until the Council had taken measures to remove orconfirm the suspicion which they at present conceived didattach itself to the mission of such a person.? 118The Talisman?Grand Master of the Holy and Valiant Order of KnightsTemplars, and you, most noble Marquis of Montserrat,? re-plied Richard, ?if it please you to retire into the adjoiningpavilion, you shall presently see what account we make ofthe tender remonstrances of our royal and princely colleaguesin this religious warfare.?The Marquis and Grand Master retired accordingly; norhad they been many minutes in the outward pavilion whenthe Eastern physician arrived, accompanied by the Baron ofGilsland and Kenneth of Scotland. The baron, however, wasa little later of entering the tent than the other two, stop-ping, perchance, to issue some orders to the warders with-out.As the Arabian physician entered, he made his obeisance,after the Oriental fashion, to the Marquis and Grand Mas-ter, whose dignity was apparent, both from their appearanceand their bearing. The Grand Master returned the saluta-tion with an expression of disdainful coldness, the Marquiswith the popular courtesy which he habitually practised tomen of every rank and nation. There was a pause, for theScottish knight, waiting for the arrival of De Vaux, presumednot, of his own authority, to enter the tent of the King ofEngland; and during this interval the Grand Master sternlydemanded of the Moslem, ?Infidel, hast thou the courage topractise thine art upon the person of an anointed sovereignof the Christian host???The sun of Allah,? answered the sage, ?shines on theNazarene as well as on the true believer, and His servant daremake no distinction betwixt them when called on to exercisethe art of healing.??Misbelieving Hakim,? said the Grand Master, ?or what-soever they call thee for an unbaptized slave of darkness, dostthou well know that thou shalt be torn asunder by wild horsesshould King Richard die under thy charge???That were hard justice,? answered the physician, ?seeingthat I can but use human means, and that the issue is writ-ten in the book of light.??Nay, reverend and valiant Grand Master,? said the Mar-quis of Montserrat, ?consider that this learned man is notacquainted with our Christian order, adopted in the fear ofGod, and for the safety of His anointed.?Be it known tothee, grave physician, whose skill we doubt not, that your 119Sir Walter Scottwisest course is to repair to the presence of the illustriousCouncil of our Holy League, and there to give account andreckoning to such wise and learned leeches as they shall nomi-nate, concerning your means of process and cure of this il-lustrious patient; so shall you escape all the danger which,rashly taking such a high matter upon your sole answer, youmay else most likely incur.??My lords,? said El Hakim, ?I understand you well. Butknowledge hath its champions as well as your military art?nay, hath sometimes had its martyrs as well as religion. Ihave the command of my sovereign, the Soldan Saladin, toheal this Nazarene King, and, with the blessing of the Prophet,I will obey his commands. If I fail, ye wear swords thirstingfor the blood of the faithful, and I proffer my body to yourweapons. But I will not reason with one uncircumcised uponthe virtue of the medicines of which I have obtained knowl-edge through the grace of the Prophet, and I play you inter-pose no delay between me and my office.??Who talks of delay?? said the Baron de Vaux, hastily en-tering the tent; ?we have had but too much already. I saluteyou, my Lord of Montserrat, and you, valiant Grand Mas-ter. But I must presently pass with this learned physician tothe bedside of my master.??My lord,? said the Marquis, in Norman-French, or thelanguage of Ouie, as it was then called, ?are you well advisedthat we came to expostulate, on the part of the Council ofthe Monarchs and Princes of the Crusade, against the risk ofpermitting an infidel and Eastern physician to tamper witha health so valuable as that of your master, King Richard???Noble Lord Marquis,? replied the Englishman bluntly, ?Ican neither use many words, nor do I delight in listening tothem; moreover, I am much more ready to believe what myeyes have seen than what my ears have heard. I am satisfiedthat this heathen can cure the sickness of King Richard, andI believe and trust he will labour to do so. Time is precious.If Mohammed?may God?s curse be on him! stood at thedoor of the tent, with such fair purpose as this Adonbec elHakim entertains, I would hold it sin to delay him for aminute. So, give ye God?en, my lords.??Nay, but,? said Conrade of Montserrat, ?the King him-self said we should be present when this same physician dealtupon him.? 120The TalismanThe baron whispered the chamberlain, probably to knowwhether the Marquis spoke truly, and then replied, ?My lords,if you will hold your patience, you are welcome to enter withus; but if you interrupt, by action or threat, this accomplishedphysician in his duty, be it known that, without respect toyour high quality, I will enforce your absence from Richard?stent; for know, I am so well satisfied of the virtue of thisman?s medicines, that were Richard himself to refuse them,by our Lady of Lanercost, I think I could find in my heart toforce him to take the means of his cure whether he would orno.?Move onward, El Hakim.?The last word was spoken in the lingua franca, and in-stantly obeyed by the physician. The Grand Master lookedgrimly on the unceremonious old soldier, but, on exchang-ing a glance with the Marquis, smoothed his frowning browas well as he could, and both followed De Vaux and the Ara-bian into the inner tent, where Richard lay expecting them,with that impatience with which the sick man watches thestep of his physician. Sir Kenneth, whose attendance seemedneither asked nor prohibited, felt himself, by the circum-stances in which he stood, entitled to follow these high dig-nitaries; but, conscious of his inferior power and rank, re-mained aloof during the scene which took place.Richard, when they entered his apartment, immediatelyexclaimed, ?So ho! a goodly fellowship come to see Richardtake his leap in the dark. My noble allies, I greet you as therepresentatives of our assembled league; Richard will againbe amongst you in his former fashion, or ye shall bear to thegrave what is left of him.?De Vaux, lives he or dies he, thouhast the thanks of thy prince. There is yet another?but thisfever hath wasted my eyesight. What, the bold Scot, whowould climb heaven without a ladder! He is welcome too.?Come, Sir Hakim, to the work, to the work!?The physician, who had already informed himself of thevarious symptoms of the King?s illness, now felt his pulse fora long time, and with deep attention, while all around stoodsilent, and in breathless expectation. The sage next filled acup with spring water, and dipped into it the small red purse,which, as formerly, he took from his bosom. When he seemedto think it sufficiently medicated, he was about to offer it tothe sovereign, who prevented him by saying, ?Hold an in-stant. Thou hast felt my pulse?let me lay my finger on thine. 121Sir Walter ScottI too, as becomes a good knight, know something of thineart.?The Arabian yielded his hand without hesitation, and hislong, slender dark fingers were for an instant enclosed, andalmost buried, in the large enfoldment of King Richard?shand.?His blood beats calm as an infant?s,? said the King; ?sothrobs not theirs who poison princes. De Vaux, whether welive or die, dismiss this Hakim with honour and safety.?Commend us, friend, to the noble Saladin. Should I die, it iswithout doubt of his faith; should I live, it will be to thankhim as a warrior would desire to be thanked.?He then raised himself in bed, took the cup in his hand,and turning to the Marquis and the Grand Master??Markwhat I say, and let my royal brethren pledge me in Cypruswine, ?To the immortal honour of the first Crusader whoshall strike lance or sword on the gate of Jerusalem; and tothe shame and eternal infamy of whomsoever shall turn backfrom the plough on which he hath laid his hand!??He drained the cup to the bottom, resigned it to the Ara-bian, and sunk back, as if exhausted, upon the cushions whichmere arranged to receive him. The physician then, with si-lent but expressive signs, directed that all should leave thetent excepting himself and De Vaux, whom no remonstrancecould induce to withdraw. The apartment was cleared ac-cordingly. 122The TalismanCHAPTER X.And now I will unclasp a secret book,And, to your quick-conceiving discontent,I?ll read you matter deep and dangerous.Henry IV, Part I.THE MARQUIS OF MONTSERRAT and the Grand Master of theKnights Templars stood together in the front of the royalpavilion, within which this singular scene had passed, andbeheld a strong guard of bills and bows drawn out to form acircle around it, and keep at distance all which might dis-turb the sleeping monarch. The soldiers wore the downcast,silent, and sullen looks with which they trail their arms at afuneral, and stepped with such caution that you could nothear a buckler ring or a sword clatter, though so many menin armour were moving around the tent. They lowered theirweapons in deep reverence as the dignitaries passed throughtheir files, but with the same profound silence.?There is a, change of cheer among these island dogs,?said the Grand Master to Conrade, when they had passedRichard?s guards. ?What hoarse tumult and revel used to bebefore this pavilion! ?nought but pitching the bar, hurlingthe ball, wrestling, roaring of songs, clattering of wine pots,and quaffing of flagons among these burly yeomen, as if theywere holding some country wake, with a Maypole in themidst of them instead of a royal standard.??Mastiffs are a faithful race,? said Conrade; ?and the Kingtheir Master has won their love by being ready to wrestle,brawl, or revel amongst the foremost of them, whenever thehumour seized him.??He is totally compounded of humours,? said the GrandMaster. ?Marked you the pledge he gave us! instead of aprayer, over his grace-cup yonder.??He would have felt it a, grace-cup, and a well-spiced onetoo,? said the Marquis, ?were Saladin like any other Turkthat ever wore turban, or turned him to Mecca at call of themuezzin. But he affects faith, and honour, and generosity, asif it were for an unbaptized dog like him to practise the vir-tuous bearing of a Christian knight. It is said he hath ap-plied to Richard to be admitted within the pale of chivalry.? 123Sir Walter Scott?By Saint Bernard!? exclaimed the Grand Master, ?it weretime then to throw off our belts and spurs, Sir Conrade,deface our armorial bearings, and renounce our burgonets,if the highest honour of Christianity were conferred on anunchristened Turk of tenpence.??You rate the Soldan cheap,? replied the Marquis; ?yetthough he be a likely man, I have seen a better heathen soldfor forty pence at the bagnio.?They were now near their horses, which stood at somedistance from the royal tent, prancing among the gallant trainof esquires and pages by whom they were attended, whenConrade, after a moment?s pause, proposed that they shouldenjoy the coolness of the evening breeze which had arisen,and, dismissing their steeds and attendants, walk homewardsto their own quarters through the lines of the extended Chris-tian camp. The Grand Master assented, and they proceededto walk together accordingly, avoiding, as if by mutual con-sent, the more inhabited parts of the canvas city, and tracingthe broad esplanade which lay between the tents and theexternal defences, Where they could converse in private, andunmarked, save by the sentinels as they passed them.They spoke for a time upon the military points and prepa-rations for defence; but this sort of discourse, in which nei-ther seemed to take interest, at length died away, and therewas a long pause, which terminated by the Marquis ofMontserrat stopping short, like a man who has formed asudden resolution, and gazing for some moments on the dark,inflexible countenance of the Grand Master, he at lengthaddressed him thus: ?Might it consist with your valour andsanctity, reverend Sir Giles Amaury, I would pray you foronce to lay aside the dark visor which you wear, and to con-verse with a friend barefaced.?The Templar half smiled.?There are light-coloured masks,? he said, ?as well as darkvisors, and the one conceals the natural features as completelyas the other.??Be it so,? said the Marquis, putting his hand to his chin,and withdrawing it with the action of one who unmasks him-self; ?there lies my disguise. And now, what think you, astouching the interests of your own order, of the prospects ofthis Crusade???This is tearing the veil from my thoughts rather than ex- 124The Talismanposing your own,? said the Grand Master; ?yet I will replywith a parable told to me by a santon of the desert. ?A certainfarmer prayed to Heaven for rain, and murmured when itfell not at his need. To punish his impatience, Allah,? saidthe santon, ?sent the Euphrates upon his farm, and he wasdestroyed, with all his possessions, even by the granting ofhis own wishes.???Most truly spoken,? said the Marquis Conrade. ?Wouldthat the ocean had swallowed up nineteen parts of the arma-ments of these Western princes! What remained would betterhave served the purpose of the Christian nobles of Palestine,the wretched remnant of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem. Leftto ourselves, we might have bent to the storm; or, moderatelysupported with money and troops, we might have compelledSaladin to respect our valour, and grant us peace and protec-tion on easy terms. But from the extremity of danger withwhich this powerful Crusade threatens the Soldan, we cannotsuppose, should it pass over, that the Saracen will suffer anyone of us to hold possessions or principalities in Syria, far lesspermit the existence of the Christian military fraternities, fromwhom they have experienced so much mischief.??Ay, but,? said the Templar, ?these adventurous Crusadersmay succeed, and again plant the Cross on the bulwarks ofZion.??And what will that advantage either the Order of theTemplars, or Conrade of Montserrat?? said the Marquis.?You it may advantage,? replied the Grand Master.?Conrade of Montserrat might become Conrade King ofJerusalem.??That sounds like something,? said the Marquis, ?and yetit rings but hollow. Godfrey of Bouillon might well choosethe crown of thorns for his emblem. Grand Master, I willconfess to you I have caught some attachment to the Easternform of government?a pure and simple monarchy shouldconsist but of king and subjects. Such is the simple and primi-tive structure?a shepherd and his flock. All this internalchain of feudal dependance is artificial and sophisticated;and I would rather hold the baton of my poor marquisatewith a firm gripe, and wield it after my pleasure, than thesceptre of a monarch, to be in effect restrained and curbedby the will of as many proud feudal barons as hold landunder the Assizes of Jerusalem. [The Assises de Jerusalem 125Sir Walter Scottwere the digest of feudal law, composed by Godfrey ofBoulogne, for the government of the Latin kingdom of Pal-estine, when reconquered from the Saracens. ?It was com-posed with advice of the patriarch and barons, the clergyand laity, and is,? says the historian Gibbon, ?a preciousmonument of feudatory jurisprudence, founded upon thoseprinciples of freedom which were essential to the system.?]A king should tread freely, Grand Master, and should not becontrolled by here a ditch, and there a fence-here a feudalprivilege, and there a mail-clad baron with his sword in hishand to maintain it. To sum the whole, I am aware that Guyde Lusignan?s claims to the throne would be preferred to mine,if Richard recovers, and has aught to say in the choice.??Enough,? said the Grand Master; ?thou hast indeed con-vinced me of thy sincerity. Others may hold the same opin-ions, but few, save Conrade of Montserrat, dared frankly avowthat he desires not the restitution of the kingdom of Jerusa-lem, but rather prefers being master of a portion of its frag-ments?like the barbarous islanders, who labour not for thedeliverance of a goodly vessel from the billows, expectingrather to enrich themselves at the expense of the wreck.??Thou wilt not betray my counsel?? said Conrade, look-ing sharply and suspiciously. ?Know, for certain, that mytongue shall never wrong my head, nor my hand forsake thedefence of either. Impeach me if thou wilt?I am preparedto defend myself in the lists against the best Templar whoever laid lance in rest.??Yet thou start?st somewhat suddenly for so bold a steed,?said the Grand Master. ?However, I swear to thee by theHoly Temple, which our Order is sworn to defend, that Iwill keep counsel with thee as a true comrade.??By which Temple?? said the Marquis of Montserrat, whoselove of sarcasm often outran his policy and discretion;?swearest thou by that on the hill of Zion, which was builtby King Solomon, or by that symbolical, emblematical edi-fice, which is said to be spoken of in the councils held in thevaults of your Preceptories, as something which infers theaggrandizement of thy valiant and venerable Order??The Templar scowled upon him with an eye of death, butanswered calmly, ?By whatever Temple I swear, be assured,Lord Marquis, my oath is sacred. I would I knew how tobind thee by one of equal obligation.? 126The Talisman?I will swear truth to thee,? said the Marquis, laughing,?by the earl?s coronet, which I hope to convert, ere thesewars are over, into something better. It feels cold on my brow,that same slight coronal; a duke?s cap of maintenance were abetter protection against such a night-breeze as now blows,and a king?s crown more preferable still, being lined withcomfortable ermine and velvet. In a word, our interests bindus together; for think not, Lord Grand Master, that, werethese allied princes to regain Jerusalem, and place a king oftheir own choosing there, they would suffer your Order, anymore than my poor marquisate, to retain the independencewhich we now hold. No, by Our Lady! In such case, theproud Knights of Saint John must again spread plasters anddress plague sores in the hospitals; and you, most puissantand venerable Knights of the Temple, must return to yourcondition of simple men-at-arms, sleep three on a pallet, andmount two upon one horse, as your present seal still expressesto have been your ancient most simple custom.??The rank, privileges, and opulence of our Order preventso much degradation as you threaten,? said the Templarhaughtily.?These are your bane,? said Conrade of Montserrat; ?andyou, as well as I, reverend Grand Master, know that, werethe allied princes to be successful in Palestine, it would betheir first point of policy to abate the independence of yourOrder, which, but for the protection of our holy father thePope, and the necessity of employing your valour in the con-quest of Palestine, you would long since have experienced.Give them complete success, and you will be flung aside, asthe splinters of a broken lance are tossed out of the tilt-yard,??There may be truth in what you say,? said the Templar,darkly smiling. ?But what were our hopes should the allieswithdraw their forces, and leave Palestine in the grasp ofSaladin???Great and assured,? replied Conrade. ?The Soldan wouldgive large provinces to maintain at his behest a body of well-appointed Frankish lances. In Egypt, in Persia, a hundredsuch auxiliaries, joined to his own light cavalry, would turnthe battle against the most fearful odds. This dependencewould be but for a time?perhaps during the life of this en-terprising Soldan; but in the East empires arise like mush-rooms. Suppose him dead, and us strengthened with a con- 127Sir Walter Scottstant succession of fiery and adventurous spirits from Eu-rope, what might we not hope to achieve, uncontrolled bythese monarchs, whose dignity throws us at present into theshade?and, were they to remain here, and succeed in thisexpedition, would willingly consign us for ever to degrada-tion and dependence???You say well, my Lord Marquis,? said the Grand Master,?and your words find an echo in my bosom. Yet must we becautious?Philip of France is wise as well as valiant.??True, and will be therefore the more easily diverted froman expedition to which, in a moment of enthusiasm, or urgedby his nobles, he rashly bound himself. He is jealous of KingRichard, his natural enemy, and longs to return to prosecuteplans of ambition nearer to Paris than Palestine. Any fairpretence will serve him for withdrawing from a scene in whichhe is aware he is wasting the force of his kingdom.??And the Duke of Austria?? said the Templar.?Oh, touching the Duke,? returned Conrade, ?his self-con-ceit and folly lead him to the same conclusions as do Philip?spolicy and wisdom. He conceives himself, God help the while,ungratefully treated, because men?s mouths?even those ofhis own minne-singers [The German minstrels were sotermed.]?are filled with the praises of King Richard, whomhe fears and hates, and in whose harm he would rejoice, likethose unbred, dastardly curs, who, if the foremost of the packis hurt by the gripe of the wolf, are much more likely toassail the sufferer from behind than to come to his assis-tance. But wherefore tell I this to thee, save to show that Iam in sincerity in desiring that this league be broken up, andthe country freed of these great monarchs with their hosts?And thou well knowest, and hast thyself seen, how all theprinces of influence and power, one alone excepted, are ea-ger to enter into treaty with the Soldan.??I acknowledge it,? said the Templar; ?he were blind thathad not seen this in their last deliberations. But lift yet thymask an inch higher, and tell me thy real reason for pressingupon the Council that Northern Englishman, or Scot, orwhatever you call yonder Knight of the Leopard, to carrytheir proposals for a treaty???There was a policy in it,? replied the Italian. ?His charac-ter of native of Britain was sufficient to meet what Saladinrequired, who knew him to belong to the band of Richard; 128The Talismanwhile his character of Scot, and certain other personal grudgeswhich I wot of, rendered it most unlikely that our envoyshould, on his return, hold any communication with thesick-bed of Richard, to whom his presence was ever unac-ceptable.??Oh, too finespun policy,? said the Grand Master; ?trustme, that Italian spiders? webs will never bind this unshornSamson of the Isle?well if you can do it with new cords,and those of the toughest. See you not that the envoy whomyou have selected so carefully hath brought us, in this physi-cian, the means of restoring the lion-hearted, bull-neckedEnglishman to prosecute his Crusading enterprise. And sosoon as he is able once more to rush on, which of the princesdare hold back? They must follow him for very shame, al-though they would march under the banner of Satan as soon.??Be content,? said Conrade of Montserrat; ?ere this physi-cian, if he work by anything short of miraculous agency, canaccomplish Richard?s cure, it may be possible to put someopen rupture betwixt the Frenchman?at least the Austrian?and his allies of England, so that the breach shall be irrecon-cilable; and Richard may arise from his bed, perhaps to com-mand his own native troops, but never again, by his soleenergy, to wield the force of the whole Crusade.??Thou art a willing archer,? said the Templar; ?but, Conradeof Montserrat, thy bow is over-slack to carry an arrow to themark.?He then stopped short, cast a suspicious glance to see thatno one overheard him, and taking Conrade by the hand,pressed it eagerly as he looked the Italian in the face, andrepeated slowly, ?Richard arise from his bed, sayest thou?Conrade, he must never arise!?The Marquis of Montserrat started. ?What! spoke you ofRichard of England?of Coeur de Lion?the champion ofChristendom??His cheek turned pale and his knees trembled as he spoke.The Templar looked at him, with his iron visage contortedinto a smile of contempt.?Knowest thou what thou look?st like, Sir Conrade, at thismoment? Not like the politic and valiant Marquis ofMontserrat not like him who would direct the Council ofPrinces and determine the fate of empires?but like a nov-ice, who, stumbling upon a conjuration in his master?s book 129Sir Walter Scottof gramarye, has raised the devil when he least thought of it,and now stands terrified at the spirit which appears beforehim.??I grant you,? said Conrade, recovering himself, ?that?unless some other sure road could be discovered?thou hasthinted at that which leads most direct to our purpose. But,blessed Mary! we shall become the curse of all Europe, themalediction of every one, from the Pope on his throne to thevery beggar at the church gate, who, ragged and leprous, inthe last extremity of human wretchedness, shall bless him-self that he is neither Giles Amaury nor Conrade ofMontserrat.??If thou takest it thus,? said the Grand Master, with thesame composure which characterized him all through thisremarkable dialogue, ?let us hold there has nothing passedbetween us?that we have spoken in our sleep?have awak-ened, and the vision is gone.??It never can depart,? answered Conrade.?Visions of ducal crowns and kingly diadems are, indeed,somewhat tenacious of their place in the imagination,? re-plied the Grand Master.?Well,? answered Conrade, ?let me but first try to breakpeace between Austria and England.?They parted. Conrade remained standing still upon thespot, and watching the flowing white cloak of the Templaras he stalked slowly away, and gradually disappeared amidthe fast-sinking darkness of the Oriental night. Proud, am-bitious, unscrupulous, and politic, the Marquis of Montserratwas yet not cruel by nature. He was a voluptuary and anepicurean, and, like many who profess this character, wasaverse, even upon selfish motives, from inflicting pain orwitnessing acts of cruelty; and he retained also a general senseof respect for his own reputation, which sometimes suppliesthe want of the better principle by which reputation is to bemaintained.?I have,? he said, as his eyes still watched the point at whichhe had seen the last slight wave of the Templar?s mantle??Ihave, in truth, raised the devil with a vengeance! Who wouldhave thought this stern, ascetic Grand Master, whose wholefortune and misfortune is merged in that of his order, wouldbe willing to do more for its advancement than I who labourfor my own interest? To check this wild Crusade was my 130The Talismanmotive, indeed, but I durst not think on the ready modewhich this determined priest has dared to suggest. Yet it isthe surest?perhaps even the safest.?Such were the Marquis?s meditations, when his mutteredsoliloquy was broken by a voice from a little distance, whichproclaimed with the emphatic tone of a herald, ?Rememberthe Holy Sepulchre!?The exhortation was echoed from post to post, for it wasthe duty of the sentinels to raise this cry from time to timeupon their periodical watch, that the host of the Crusadersmight always have in their remembrance the purpose of theirbeing in arms. But though Conrade was familiar with thecustom, and had heard the warning voice on all former oc-casions as a matter of habit, yet it came at the present mo-ment so strongly in contact with his own train of thought,that it seemed a voice from Heaven warning him against theiniquity which his heart meditated. He looked around anx-iously, as if, like the patriarch of old, though from very dif-ferent circumstances, he was expecting some ram caught in athicket some substitution for the sacrifice which his com-rade proposed to offer, not to the Supreme Being, but to theMoloch of their own ambition. As he looked, the broad foldsof the ensign of England, heavily distending itself to the fail-ing night-breeze, caught his eye. It was displayed upon anartificial mound, nearly in the midst of the camp, whichperhaps of old some Hebrew chief or champion had chosenas a memorial of his place of rest. If so, the name was nowforgotten, and the Crusaders had christened it Saint George?sMount, because from that commanding height the bannerof England was supereminently displayed, as if an emblemof sovereignty over the many distinguished, noble, and evenroyal ensigns, which floated in lower situations.A quick intellect like that of Conrade catches ideas fromthe glance of a moment. A single look on the standard seemedto dispel the uncertainty of mind which had affected him.He walked to his pavilion with the hasty and determinedstep of one who has adopted a plan which he is resolved toachieve, dismissed the almost princely train who waited toattend him, and, as he committed himself to his couch,muttered his amended resolution, that the milder means areto be tried before the more desperate are resorted to.?To-morrow,? he said, ?I sit at the board of the Archduke 131Sir Walter Scottof Austria. We will see what can be done to advance ourpurpose before prosecuting the dark suggestions of thisTemplar.?CHAPTER XI.One thing is certain in our Northern land?Allow that birth or valour, wealth or wit,Give each precedence to their possessor,Envy, that follows on such eminence,As comes the lyme-hound on the roebuck?s trace,Shall pull them down each one.Sir David Lindsay.LEOPOLD, Grand Duke of Austria, was the first possessor ofthat noble country to whom the princely rank belonged. Hehad been raised to the ducal sway in the German Empire onaccount of his near relationship to the Emperor, Henry theStern, and held under his government the finest provinceswhich are watered by the Danube. His character has beenstained in history on account of one action of violence andperfidy, which arose out of these very transactions in theHoly Land; and yet the shame of having made Richard aprisoner when he returned through his dominions; unat- 132The Talismantended and in disguise, was not one which flowed fromLeopold?s natural disposition. We was rather a weak and avain than an ambitious or tyrannical prince. His mental pow-ers resembled the qualities of his person. He was tall, strong,and handsome, with a complexion in which red and whitewere strongly contrasted, and had long flowing locks of fairhair. But there was an awkwardness in his gait which seemedas if his size was not animated by energy sufficient to put inmotion such a mass; and in the same manner, wearing therichest dresses, it always seemed as if they became him not.As a prince, he appeared too little familiar with his own dig-nity; and being often at a loss how to assert his authoritywhen the occasion demanded it, he frequently thought him-self obliged to recover, by acts and expressions of ill-timedviolence, the ground which might have been easily and grace-fully maintained by a little more presence of mind in thebeginning of the controversy.Not only were these deficiencies visible to others, but theArchduke himself could not but sometimes entertain a pain-ful consciousness that he was not altogether fit to maintainand assert the high rank which he had acquired; and to thiswas joined the strong, and sometimes the just, suspicion thatothers esteemed him lightly accordingly.When he first joined the Crusade, with a most princelyattendance, Leopold had desired much to enjoy the friend-ship and intimacy of Richard, and had made such advancestowards cultivating his regard as the King of England ought,in policy, to have received and answered. But the Archduke,though not deficient in bravery, was so infinitely inferior toCoeur de Lion in that ardour of mind which wooed dangeras a bride, that the King very soon held him in a certaindegree of contempt. Richard, also, as a Norman prince, apeople with whom temperance was habitual, despised theinclination of the German for the pleasures of the table, andparticularly his liberal indulgence in the use of wine. Forthese, and other personal reasons, the King of England verysoon looked upon the Austrian Prince with feelings of con-tempt, which he was at no pains to conceal or modify, andwhich, therefore, were speedily remarked, and returned withdeep hatred, by the suspicious Leopold. The discord betweenthem was fanned by the secret and politic arts of Philip ofFrance, one of the most sagacious monarchs of the time, 133Sir Walter Scottwho, dreading the fiery and overbearing character of Rich-ard, considering him as his natural rival, and feeling offended,moreover, at the dictatorial manner in which he, a vassal ofFrance for his Continental domains, conducted himself to-wards his liege lord, endeavoured to strengthen his own party,and weaken that of Richard, by uniting the Crusading princesof inferior degree in resistance to what he termed the usurp-ing authority of the King of England. Such was the state ofpolitics and opinions entertained by the Archduke of Aus-tria, when Conrade of Montserrat resolved upon employinghis jealousy of England as the means of dissolving, or loos-ening at least, the league of the Crusaders.The time which he chose for his visit was noon; and thepretence, to present the Archduke with some choice Cypruswine which had lately fallen into his hands, and discuss itscomparative merits with those of Hungary and of the Rhine.An intimation of his purpose was, of course, answered by acourteous invitation to partake of the Archducal meal, andevery effort was used to render it fitting the splendour of asovereign prince. Yet the refined taste of the Italian saw morecumbrous profusion than elegance or splendour in the dis-play of provisions under which the board groaned.The Germans, though still possessing the martial and frankcharacter of their ancestors?who subdued the Roman Em-pire?had retained withal no slight tinge of their barbarism.The practices and principles of chivalry were not carried tosuch a nice pitch amongst them as amongst the French andEnglish knights, nor were they strict observers of the pre-scribed rules of society, which among those nations weresupposed to express the height of civilization. Sitting at thetable of the Archduke, Conrade was at once stunned andamused with the clang of Teutonic sounds assaulting his earson all sides, notwithstanding the solemnity of a princely ban-quet. Their dress seemed equally fantastic to him, many ofthe Austrian nobles retaining their long beards, and almostall of them wearing short jerkins of various colours, cut, andflourished, and fringed in a manner not common in West-ern Europe.Numbers of dependants, old and young, attended in thepavilion, mingled at times in the conversation, received fromtheir masters the relics of the entertainment, and devouredthem as they stood behind the backs of the company. Jesters, 134The Talismandwarfs, and minstrels were there in unusual numbers, andmore noisy and intrusive than they were permitted to be inbetter regulated society. As they were allowed to share freelyin the wine, which flowed round in large quantities, theirlicensed tumult was the more excessive.All this while, and in the midst of a clamour and confu-sion which would better have become a German tavern dur-ing a fair than the tent of a sovereign prince, the Archdukewas waited upon with a minuteness of form and observancewhich showed how anxious he was to maintain rigidly thestate and character to which his elevation had entitled him.He was served on the knee, and only by pages of noble blood,fed upon plate of silver, and drank his Tokay and Rhenishwines from a cup of gold. His ducal mantle was splendidlyadorned with ermine, his coronet might have equalled invalue a royal crown, and his feet, cased in velvet shoes (thelength of which, peaks included, might be two feet), restedupon a footstool of solid silver. But it served partly to inti-mate the character of the man, that, although desirous toshow attention to the Marquis of Montserrat, whom he hadcourteously placed at his right hand, he gave much more ofhis attention to his Spruch-Sprecher?that is, his man of con-versation, or Sayer-of-Sayings ?who stood behind the Duke?sright shoulder.This personage was well attired in a cloak and doublet ofblack velvet, the last of which was decorated with varioussilver and gold coins stitched upon it, in memory of themunificent princes who had conferred them, and bearing ashort staff to which also bunches of silver coins were attachedby rings, which he jingled by way of attracting attention whenhe was about to say anything which he judged worthy of it.This person?s capacity in the household of the Archduke wassomewhat betwixt that of a minstrel and a counsellor. Hewas by turns a flatterer, a poet, and an orator; and those whodesired to be well with the Duke generally studied to gainthe good-will of the Spruch-Sprecher.Lest too much of this officer?s wisdom should become tire-some, the Duke?s other shoulder was occupied by his Hoff-Narr, or court-jester, called Jonas Schwanker, who made al-most as much noise with his fool?s cap, bells, and bauble, asdid the orator, or man of talk, with his jingling baton.These two personages threw out grave and comic nonsense 135Sir Walter Scottalternately; while their master, laughing or applauding themhimself, yet carefully watched the countenance of his nobleguest, to discern what impressions so accomplished a cava-lier received from this display of Austrian eloquence and wit.It is hard to say whether the man of wisdom or the man offolly contributed most to the amusement of the party, orstood highest in the estimation of their princely master; butthe sallies of both seemed excellently well received. Some-times they became rivals for the conversation, and clangedtheir flappers in emulation of each other with a most alarm-ing contention; but, in general, they seemed on such goodterms, and so accustomed to support each other?s play, thatthe Spruch-Sprecher often condescended to follow up thejester?s witticisms with an explanation, to render them moreobvious to the capacity of the audience, so that his wisdombecame a sort of commentary on the buffoon?s folly. Andsometimes, in requital, the Hoff-Narr, with a pithy jest,wound up the conclusion of the orator?s tedious harangue.Whatever his real sentiments might be, Conrade took es-pecial care that his countenance should express nothing butsatisfaction with what he heard, and smiled or applauded aszealously, to all appearance, as the Archduke himself at thesolemn folly of the Spruch-Sprecher and the gibbering wit ofthe fool. In fact, he watched carefully until the one or othershould introduce some topic favourable to the purpose whichwas uppermost in his mind.It was not long ere the King of England was brought onthe carpet by the jester, who had been accustomed to con-sider Dickon of the Broom (which irreverent epithet he sub-stituted for Richard Plantagenet) as a subject of mirth, ac-ceptable and inexhaustible. The orator, indeed, was silent,and it was only when applied to by Conrade that he ob-served, ?The genista, or broom-plant, was an emblem ofhumility; and it would be well when those who wore it wouldremember the warning.?The allusion to the illustrious badge of Plantagenet wasthus rendered sufficiently manifest, and Jonas Schwanker ob-served that they who humbled themselves had been exaltedwith a vengeance. ?Honour unto whom honour is due,?answered the Marquis of Montserrat. ?We have all had somepart in these marches and battles, and methinks other princesmight share a little in the renown which Richard of England 136The Talismanengrosses amongst minstrels and minne-singers. Has no oneof the joyeuse science here present a song in praise of theroyal Archduke of Austria, our princely entertainer??Three minstrels emulously stepped forward with voice andharp. Two were silenced with difficulty by the Spruch-Sprecher,who seemed to act as master of the revels, and a hearing wasat length procured for the poet preferred, who sung, in highGerman, stanzas which may be thus translated:??What brave chief shall head the forces,Where the red-cross legions gather?Best of horsemen, best of horses,Highest head and fairest feather.?Here the orator, jingling his staff, interrupted the bard tointimate to the party?what they might not have inferredfrom the description?that their royal host was the partyindicated, and a full-crowned goblet went round to the ac-clamation, hoch lebe der Herzog Leopold! Another stanza fol-lowed:??Ask not Austria why, ?midst princes,Still her banner rises highest;Ask as well the strong-wing?d eagle,Why to heaven he soars the highest.??The eagle,? said the expounder of dark sayings, ?is thecognizance of our noble lord the Archduke?of his royalGrace, I would say?and the eagle flies the highest and near-est to the sun of all the feathered creation.??The lion hath taken a spring above the eagle,? saidConrade carelessly.The Archduke reddened, and fixed his eyes on the speaker,while the Spruch-Sprecher answered, after a minute?s consid-eration, ?The Lord Marquis will pardon me?a lion cannotfly above an eagle, because no lion hath got wings.??Except the lion of Saint Mark,? responded the jester.?That is the Venetian?s banner,? said the Duke; ?but assur-edly that amphibious race, half nobles, half merchants, willnot dare to place their rank in comparison with ours.??Nay, it was not of the Venetian lion that I spoke,? said theMarquis of Montserrat, ?but of the three lions passant of 137Sir Walter ScottEngland. Formerly, it is said, they were leopards; but nowthey are become lions at all points, and must take prece-dence of beast, fish, or fowl, or woe worth the gainstander.??Mean you seriously, my lord?? said the Austrian, nowconsiderably flushed with wine. ?Think you that Richard ofEngland asserts any pre-eminence over the free sovereignswho have been his voluntary allies in this Crusade???I know not but from circumstances,? answered Conrade.?Yonder hangs his banner alone in the midst of our camp, asif he were king and generalissimo of our whole Christianarmy.??And do you endure this so patiently, and speak of it socoldly?? said the Archduke.?Nay, my lord,? answered Conrade, ?it cannot concernthe poor Marquis of Montserrat to contend against an in-jury patiently submitted to by such potent princes as Philipof France and Leopold of Austria. What dishonour you arepleased to submit to cannot be a disgrace to me.?Leopold closed his fist, and struck on the table with vio-lence.?I have told Philip of this,? he said. ?I have often told himthat it was our duty to protect the inferior princes againstthe usurpation of this islander; but he answers me ever withcold respects of their relations together as suzerain and vas-sal, and that it were impolitic in him to make an open breachat this time and period.??The world knows that Philip is wise,? said Conrade, ?andwill judge his submission to be policy. Yours, my lord, youcan yourself alone account for; but I doubt not you havedeep reasons for submitting to English domination.??I submit!? said Leopold indignantly??I, the Archdukeof Austria, so important and vital a limb of the Holy RomanEmpire?I submit myself to this king of half an island, thisgrandson of a Norman bastard! No, by Heaven! The campand all Christendom shall see that I know how to right my-self, and whether I yield ground one inch to the Englishbandog.?Up, my lieges and merry men; up and follow me!We will?and that without losing one instant?place theeagle of Austria where she shall float as high as ever floatedthe cognizance of king or kaiser.?With that he started from his seat, and amidst the tumul-tuous cheering of his guests and followers, made for the door 138The Talismanof the pavilion, and seized his own banner, which stoodpitched before it.?Nay, my lord,? said Conrade, affecting to interfere, ?itwill blemish your wisdom to make an affray in the camp atthis hour; and perhaps it is better to submit to the usurpa-tion of England a little longer than to???Not an hour, not a moment longer,? vociferated the Duke;and with the banner in his hand, and followed by his shout-ing guests and attendants, marched hastily to the centralmount, from which the banner of England floated, and laidhis hand on the standard-spear, as if to pluck it from theground.?My master, my dear master!? said Jonas Schwanker, throw-ing his arms about the Duke, ?take heed?lions have teeth???And eagles have claws,? said the Duke, not relinquishinghis hold on the banner-staff, yet hesitating to pull it fromthe ground.The speaker of sentences, notwithstanding such was hisoccupation, had nevertheless some intervals of sound sense.He clashed his staff loudly, and Leopold, as if by habit, turnedhis head towards his man of counsel.?The eagle is king among the fowls of the air,? said the Spruch-Sprecher, ?as is the lion among the beasts of the field?each hashis dominion, separated as wide as England and Germany. Dothou, noble eagle, no dishonour to the princely lion, but letyour banners remain floating in peace side by side.?Leopold withdrew his hand from the banner-spear, andlooked round for Conrade of Montserrat, but he saw himnot; for the Marquis, so soon as he saw the mischief afoot,had withdrawn himself from the crowd, taking care, in thefirst place, to express before several neutral persons his regretthat the Archduke should have chosen the hours after din-ner to avenge any wrong of which he might think he had aright to complain. Not seeing his guest, to whom he wishedmore particularly to have addressed himself, the Archdukesaid aloud that, having no wish to breed dissension in thearmy of the Cross, he did but vindicate his own privilegesand right to stand upon an equality with the King of En-gland, without desiring, as he might have done, to advancehis banner?which he derived from emperors, his progeni-tors?above that of a mere descendant of the Counts ofAnjou; and in the meantime he commanded a cask of wine 139Sir Walter Scottto be brought hither and pierced, for regaling the bystand-ers, who, with tuck of drum and sound of music, quaffedmany a carouse round the Austrian standard.This disorderly scene was not acted without a degree ofnoise, which alarmed the whole camp.The critical hour had arrived at which the physician, ac-cording to the rules of his art, had predicted that his royalpatient might be awakened with safety, and the sponge hadbeen applied for that purpose; and the leech had not mademany observations ere he assured the Baron of Gilsland thatthe fever had entirely left his sovereign, and that, such was thehappy strength of his constitution, it would not be even nec-essary, as in most cases, to give a second dose of the powerfulmedicine. Richard himself seemed to be of the same opinion,for, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, he demanded of De Vauxwhat present sum of money was in the royal coffers.The baron could not exactly inform him of the amount.?It matters not,? said Richard; ?be it greater or smaller,bestow it all on this learned leech, who hath, I trust, givenme back again to the service of the Crusade. If it be less thana thousand byzants, let him have jewels to make it up.??I sell not the wisdom with which Allah has endowed me,?answered the Arabian physician; ?and be it known to you,great Prince, that the divine medicine of which you havepartaken would lose its effects in my unworthy hands did Iexchange its virtues either for gold or diamonds.??The Physician refuseth a gratuity!? said De Vaux to him-self. ?This is more extraordinary than his being a hundredyears old.??Thomas de Vaux,? said Richard, ?thou knowest no cour-age but what belongs to the sword, no bounty and virtue butwhat are used in chivalry. I tell thee that this Moor, in hisindependence, might set an example to them who accountthemselves the flower of knighthood.??It is reward enough for me,? said the Moor, folding hisarms on his bosom, and maintaining an attitude at once re-spectful and dignified, ?that so great a king as the MelechRic [Richard was thus called by the Eastern nations.] shouldthus speak of his servant.?But now let me pray you againto compose yourself on your couch; for though I think thereneeds no further repetition of the divine draught, yet injurymight ensue from any too early exertion ere pour strength 140The Talismanbe entirely restored.??I must obey thee, Hakim,? said the King; ?yet believe me,my bosom feels so free from the wasting fire which for somany days hath scorched it, that I care not how soon I ex-pose it to a brave man?s lance.?But hark! what mean theseshouts, and that distant music, in the camp? Go, Thomas deVaux, and make inquiry.??It is the Archduke Leopold,? said De Vaux, returning af-ter a minute?s absence, ?who makes with his pot-compan-ions some procession through the camp.??The drunken fool!? exclaimed King Richard; ?can he notkeep his brutal inebriety within the veil of his pavilion, that hemust needs show his shame to all Christendom??What sayyou, Sir Marquis?? he added, addressing himself to Conradeof Montserrat, who at that moment entered the tent.?Thus much, honoured Prince,? answered the Marquis,?that I delight to see your Majesty so well, and so far recov-ered; and that is a long speech for any one to make who haspartaken of the Duke of Austria?s hospitality.??What! you have been dining with the Teutonic wine-skin!?said the monarch. ?And what frolic has he found out to causeall this disturbance? Truly, Sir Conrade, I have still held youso good a reveller that I wonder at your quitting the game.?De Vaux, who had got a little behind the King, now ex-erted himself by look and sign to make the Marquis under-stand that he should say nothing to Richard of what waspassing without. But Conrade understood not, or heedednot, the prohibition.?What the Archduke does,? he said, ?is of little consequenceto any one, least of all to himself, since he probably knowsnot what he is acting; yet, to say truth, it is a gambol I shouldnot like to share in, since he is pulling down the banner ofEngland from Saint George?s Mount, in the centre of thecamp yonder, and displaying his own in its stead.??What sayest thou?? exclaimed the King, in a tone whichmight have waked the dead.?Nay,? said the Marquis, ?let it not chafe your Highnessthat a fool should act according to his folly???Speak not to me,? said Richard, springing from his couch,and casting on his clothes with a dispatch which seemedmarvellous? ?Speak not to me, Lord Marquis!?De Multon,I command thee speak not a word to me?he that breathes 141Sir Walter Scottbut a syllable is no friend to Richard Plantagenet.?Hakim,be silent, I charge thee!?All this while the King was hastily clothing himself, and,with the last word, snatched his sword from the pillar of thetent, and without any other weapon, or calling any attendance,he rushed out of his pavilion. Conrade, holding up his handsas if in astonishment, seemed willing to enter into conversa-tion with De Vaux; but Sir Thomas pushed rudely past him,and calling to one of the royal equerries, said hastily, ?Fly toLord Salisbury?s quarters, and let him get his men togetherand follow me instantly to Saint George?s Mount. Tell him theKing?s fever has left his blood and settled in his brain.?Imperfectly heard, and still more imperfectly compre-hended, by the startled attendant whom De Vaux addressedthus hastily, the equerry and his fellow-servants of the royalchamber rushed hastily into the tents of the neighbouringnobility, and quickly spread an alarm, as general as the causeseemed vague, through the whole British forces. The En-glish soldiers, waked in alarm from that noonday rest whichthe heat of the climate had taught them to enjoy as a luxury,hastily asked each other the cause of the tumult, and with-out waiting an answer, supplied by the force of their ownfancy the want of information. Some said the Saracens werein the camp, some that the King?s life was attempted, somethat he had died of the fever the preceding night, many thathe was assassinated by the Duke of Austria. The nobles andofficers, at an equal loss with the common men? to ascertainthe real cause of the disorder, laboured only to get their fol-lowers under arms and under authority, lest their rashnessshould occasion some great misfortune to the Crusadingarmy. The English trumpets sounded loud, shrill, and con-tinuously. The alarm-cry of ?Bows and bills, bows and bills!?was heard from quarter to quarter, again and again shouted,and again and again answered by the presence of the readywarriors, and their national invocation, ?Saint George formerry England!?The alarm went through the nearest quarter of the camp,and men of all the various nations assembled, where, per-haps, every people in Christendom had their representatives,flew to arms, and drew together under circumstances of gen-eral confusion, of which they knew neither the cause nor theobject. It was, however, lucky, amid a scene so threatening, 142The Talismanthat the Earl of Salisbury, while he hurried after De Vaux?ssummons with a few only of the readiest English men-at-arms, directed the rest of the English host to be drawn upand kept under arms, to advance to Richard?s succour if ne-cessity should require, but in fit array and under due com-mand, and not with the tumultuary haste which their ownalarm and zeal for the King?s safety might have dictated.In the meanwhile, without regarding for one instant theshouts, the cries, the tumult which began to thicken aroundhim, Richard, with his dress in the last disorder, and hissheathed blade under his arm, pursued his way with the ut-most speed, followed only by De Vaux and one or two house-hold servants, to Saint George?s Mount.He outsped even the alarm which his impetuosity onlyhad excited, and passed the quarter of his own gallant troopsof Normandy, Poitou, Gascony, and Anjou before the dis-turbance had reached them, although the noise accompany-ing the German revel had induced many of the soldiery toget on foot to listen. The handful of Scots were also quar-tered in the vicinity, nor had they been disturbed by the up-roar. But the King?s person and his haste were both remarkedby the Knight of the Leopard, who, aware that danger mustbe afoot, and hastening to share in it, snatched his shieldand sword, and united himself to De Vaux, who with somedifficulty kept pace with his impatient and fiery master. DeVaux answered a look of curiosity, which the Scottish knightdirected towards him, with a shrug of his broad shoulders,and they continued, side by side, to pursue Richard?s steps.The King was soon at the foot of Saint George?s Mount,the sides as well as platform of which were now surroundedand crowded, partly by those belonging to the Duke ofAustria?s retinue, who were celebrating, with shouts of jubi-lee, the act which they considered as an assertion of nationalhonour; partly by bystanders of different nations, whom dis-like to the English, or mere curiosity, had assembled togetherto witness the end of these extraordinary proceedings.Through this disorderly troop Richard burst his way, like agoodly ship under full sail, which cleaves her forcible pas-sage through the rolling billows, and heeds not that theyunite after her passage and roar upon her stern.The summit of the eminence was a small level space, onwhich were pitched the rival banners, surrounded still by 143Sir Walter Scottthe Archduke?s friends and retinue. In the midst of the circlewas Leopold himself, still contemplating with self-satisfac-tion the deed he had done, and still listening to the shouts ofapplause which his partisans bestowed with no sparing breath.While he was in this state of self-gratulation, Richard burstinto the circle, attended, indeed, only by two men, but inhis own headlong energies an irresistible host.?Who has dared,? he said, laying his hands upon the Aus-trian standard, and speaking in a voice like the sound whichprecedes an earthquake??Who has dared to place this pal-try rag beside the banner of England??The Archduke wanted not personal courage, and it wasimpossible he could hear this question without reply. Yet somuch was he troubled and surprised by the unexpected ar-rival of Richard, and affected by the general awe inspired byhis ardent and unyielding character, that the demand wastwice repeated, in a tone which seemed to challenge heavenand earth, ere the Archduke replied, with such firmness ashe could command, ?It was I, Leopold of Austria.??Then shall Leopold of Austria,? replied Richard, ?presentrysee the rate at which his banner and his pretensions are heldby Richard of England.?So saying, he pulled up the standard-spear, splintered it topieces, threw the banner itself on the ground, and placed hisfoot upon it.?Thus,? said he,? I trample on the banner of Austria. Isthere a knight among your Teutonic chivalry dare impeachmy deed??There was a momentary silence; but there are no bravermen than the Germans.?I,? and ?I,? and ?I,? was heard from several knights of theDuke?s followers; and he himself added his voice to thosewhich accepted the King of England?s defiance.?Why do we daily thus?? said the Earl Wallenrode, a gi-gantic warrior from the frontiers of Hungary. ?Brethren andnoble gentlemen, this man?s foot is on the honour of yourcountry?let us rescue it from violation, and down with thepride of England!?So saying, he drew his sword, and struck at the King ablow which might have proved fatal, had not the Scot inter-cepted and caught it upon his shield.?I have sworn,? said King Richard?and his voice was heard 144The Talismanabove all the tumult, which now waxed wild and loud??never to strike one whose shoulder bears the cross; there-fore live, Wallenrode?but live to remember Richard of En-gland.?As he spoke, he grasped the tall Hungarian round the waist,and, unmatched in wrestling, as in other military exercises,hurled him backwards with such violence that the mass flewas if discharged from a military engine, not only through thering of spectators who witnessed the extraordinary scene, butover the edge of the mount itself, down the steep side ofwhich Wallenrode rolled headlong, until, pitching at lengthupon his shoulder, he dislocatcd the bone, and lay like onedead. This almost supernatural display of strength did notencourage either the Duke or any of his followers to renew apersonal contest so inauspiciously commenced. Those whostood farthest back did, indeed, clash their swords, and cryout, ?Cut the island mastiff to pieces!? but those who werenearer veiled, perhaps, their personal fears under an affectedregard for order, and cried, for the most part, ?Peace! Peace!the peace of the Cross?the peace of Holy Church and ourFather the Pope!?These various cries of the assailants, contradicting eachother, showed their irresolution; while Richard, his foot stillon the archducal banner, glared round him with an eye thatseemed to seek an enemy, and from which the angry noblesshrunk appalled, as from the threatened grasp of a lion. DeVaux and the Knight of the Leopard kept their places besidehim; and though the swords which they held were stillsheathed, it was plain that they were prompt to protectRichard?s person to the very last, and their size and remark-able strength plainly showed the defence would be a desper-ate one.Salisbury and his attendants were also now drawing near,with bills and partisans brandished, and bows already bended.At this moment King Philip of France, attended by one ortwo of his nobles, came on the platform to inquire the causeof the disturbance, and made gestures of surprise at findingthe King of England raised from his sick-bed, and confront-ing their common ally, the Duke of Austria, in such a men-acing and insulting posture. Richard himself blushed at be-ing discovered by Philip, whose sagacity he respected as muchas he disliked his person, in an attitude neither becoming his 145Sir Walter Scottcharacter as a monarch, nor as a Crusader; and it was ob-served that he withdrew his foot, as if accidentally, from thedishonoured banner, and exchanged his look of violent emo-tion for one of affected composure and indifference. Leopoldalso struggled to attain some degree of calmness, mortifiedas he was by having been seen by Philip in the act of pas-sively submitting to the insults of the fiery King of England.Possessed of many of those royal qualities for which hewas termed by his subjects the August, Philip might be termedthe Ulysses, as Richard was indisputably the Achilles, of theCrusade. The King of France was sagacious, wise, deliberatein council, steady and calm in action, seeing clearly, andsteadily pursuing, the measures most for the interest of hiskingdom?dignified and royal in his deportment, brave inperson, but a politician rather than a warrior. The Crusadewould have been no choice of his own; but the spirit wascontagious, and the expedition was enforced upon him bythe church, and by the unanimous wish of his nobility. Inany other situation, or in a milder age, his character mighthave stood higher than that of the adventurous Coeur deLion. But in the Crusade, itself an undertaking wholly irra-tional, sound reason was the quality of all others least esti-mated, and the chivalric valour which both the age and theenterprise demanded was considered as debased if mingledwith the least touch of discretion. So that the merit of Philip,compared with that of his haughty rival, showed like theclear but minute flame of a lamp placed near the glare of ahuge, blazing torch, which, not possessing half the utility,makes ten times more impression on the eye. Philip felt hisinferiority in public opinion with the pain natural to a high-spirited prince; and it cannot be wondered at if he took suckopportunities as offered for placing his own character in moreadvantageous contrast with that of his rival. The presentseemed one of those occasions in which prudence and calm-ness might reasonably expect to triumph over obstinacy andimpetuous violence.?What means this unseemly broil betwixt the sworn breth-ren of the Cross?the royal Majesty of England and theprincely Duke Leopold? How is it possible that those whoare the chiefs and pillars of this holy expedition???A truce with thy remonstrance, France,? said Richard,enraged inwardly at finding himself placed on a sort of equal- 146The Talismanity with Leopold, yet not knowing how to resent it. ?Thisduke, or prince, or pillar, if you will, hath been insolent, andI have chastised him?that is all. Here is a coil, forsooth,because of spurning a hound!??Majesty of France,? said the Duke, ?I appeal to you andevery sovereign prince against the foul indignity which I havesustained. This King of England hath pulled down my ban-ner-torn and trampled on it.??Because he had the audacity to plant it beside mine,? saidRichard.?My rank as thine equal entitled me,? replied the Duke,emboldened by the presence of Philip.?Assert such equality for thy person,? said King Richard,?and, by Saint George, I will treat thy person as I did thybroidered kerchief there, fit but for the meanest use to whichkerchief may be put.??Nay, but patience, brother of England,? said Philip, ?andI will presently show Austria that he is wrong in this mat-ter.?Do not think, noble Duke,? he continued, ?that, inpermitting the standard of England to occupy the highestpoint in our camp, we, the independent sovereigns of theCrusade, acknowledge any inferiority to the royal Richard.It were inconsistent to think so, since even the Oriflammeitself?the great banner of France, to which the royal Rich-ard himself, in respect of his French possessions, is but avassal?holds for the present an inferior place to the Lionsof England. But as sworn brethren of the Cross, militarypilgrims, who, laying aside the pomp and pride of this world,are hewing with our swords the way to the Holy Sepulchre,I myself, and the other princes, have renounced to King Ri-chard, from respect to his high renown and great feats ofarms, that precedence which elsewhere, and upon othermotives, would not have been yielded. I am satisfied that,when your royal grace of Austria shall have considered this,you will express sorrow for having placed your banner onthis spot, and that the royal Majesty of England will thengive satisfaction for the insult he has offered.?The Spruch-Sprecher and the jester had both retired to asafe distance when matters seemed coming to blows; but re-turned when words, their own commodity, seemed againabout to become the order of the day.The man of proverbs was so delighted with Philip?s politic 147Sir Walter Scottspeech that he clashed his baton at the conclusion, by way ofemphasis, and forgot the presence in which he was, so far asto say aloud that he himself had never said a wiser thing inhis life.?It may be so,? whispered Jonas Schwanker, ?but we shallbe whipped if you speak so loud.??The Duke answered sullenly that he would refer his quarrelto the General Council of the Crusade?a motion whichPhilip highly applauded, as qualified to take away a scandalmost harmful to Christendom.Richard, retaining the same careless attitude, listened toPhilip until his oratory seemed exhausted, and then saidaloud, ?I am drowsy?this fever hangs about me still. Brotherof France, thou art acquainted with my humour, and that Ihave at all times but few words to spare. Know, therefore, atonce, I will submit a matter touching the honour of En-gland neither to Prince, Pope, nor Council. Here stands mybanner?whatsoever pennon shall be reared within threebutts? length of it?ay, were it the Oriflamme, of which youwere, I think, but now speaking?shall be treated as thatdishonoured rag; nor will I yield other satisfaction than thatwhich these poor limbs can render in the lists to any boldchallenge?ay, were it against five champions instead of one.??Now,? said the jester, whispering his companion, ?that isas complete a piece of folly as if I myself had said it; but yet,I think, there may be in this matter a greater fool than Rich-ard yet.??And who may that be?? asked the man of wisdom.?Philip,? said the jester, ?or our own Royal Duke, shouldeither accept the challenge. But oh, most sage Spruch-Sprecher,what excellent kings wouldst thou and I have made, sincethose on whose heads these crowns have fallen can play theproverb-monger and the fool as completely as ourselves!?While these worthies plied their offices apart, Philip an-swered calmly to the almost injurious defiance of Richard,?I came not hither to awaken fresh quarrels, contrary to theoath we have sworn, and the holy cause in which we haveengaged. I part from my brother of England as brothersshould part, and the only strife between the Lions of En-gland and the Lilies of France shall be which shall be carrieddeepest into the ranks of the infidels.??It is a bargain, my royal brother,? said Richard, stretching 148The Talismanout his hand with all the frankness which belonged to hisrash but generous disposition; ?and soon may we have theopportunity to try this gallant and fraternal wager.??Let this noble Duke also partake in the friendship of thishappy moment,? said Philip; and the Duke approached half-sullenly, half-willing to enter into some accommodation.?I think not of fools, nor of their folly,? said Richard care-lessly; and the Archduke, turning his back on him, with-drew from the ground.Richard looked after him as he retired.?There is a sort of glow-worm courage,? he said, ?that showsonly by night. I must not leave this banner unguarded indarkness; by daylight the look of the Lions will alone defendit. Here, Thomas of Gilsland, I give thee the charge of thestandard?watch over the honour of England.??Her safety is yet more dear to me,? said De Vaux, ?andthe life of Richard is the safety of England. I must have yourHighness back to your tent, and that without furthertarriance.??Thou art a rough and peremptory nurse, De Vaux,? saidthe king, smiling; and then added, addressing Sir Kenneth,?Valiant Scot, I owe thee a boon, and I will pay it richly.There stands the banner of England! Watch it as novice doeshis armour on the night before he is dubbed. Stir not from itthree spears? length, and defend it with thy body against in-jury or insult. Sound thy bugle if thou art assailed by morethan three at once. Dost thou undertake the charge???Willingly,? said Kenneth; ?and will discharge it upon pen-alty of my head. I will but arm me, and return hither in-stantly.?The Kings of France and England then took formal leaveof each other, hiding, under an appearance of courtesy, thegrounds of complaint which either had against the other?Richard against Philip, for what he deemed an officious in-terference betwixt him and Austria, and Philip against Coeurde Lion, for the disrespectful manner in which his media-tion had been received. Those whom this disturbance hadassembled now drew off in different directions, leaving thecontested mount in the same solitude which had subsistedtill interrupted by the Austrian bravado. Men judged of theevents of the day according to their partialities, and whilethe English charged the Austrian with having afforded the 149Sir Walter Scottfirst ground of quarrel, those of other nations concurred incasting the greater blame upon the insular haughtiness andassuming character of Richard.?Thou seest,? said the Marquis of Montserrat to the GrandMaster of the Templars, ?that subtle courses are more effec-tive than violence. I have unloosed the bonds which heldtogether this bunch of sceptres and lances?thou wilt seethem shortly fall asunder.??I would have called thy plan a good one,? said the Templar,?had there been but one man of courage among yonder cold-blooded Austrians to sever the bonds of which you speakwith his sword. A knot that is unloosed may again be fas-tened, but not so the cord which has been cut to pieces.?CHAPTER XII.Tis woman that seduces all mankind.Gay.IN THE DAYS OF CHIVALRY, a dangerous post or a perilous ad-venture was a reward frequently assigned to military braveryas a compensation for its former trials; just as, in ascending aprecipice, the surmounting one crag only lifts the climber topoints yet more dangerous.It was midnight, and the moon rode clear and high inheaven, when Kenneth of Scotland stood upon his watch onSaint George?s Mount, beside the banner of England, a soli-tary sentinel, to protect the emblem of that nation againstthe insults which might be meditated among the thousandswhom Richard?s pride had made his enemies. High thoughtsrolled, one after each other, upon the mind of the warrior. Itseemed to him as if he had gained some favour in the eyes ofthe chivalrous monarch, who till now had not seemed todistinguish him among the crowds of brave men whom his 150The Talismanrenown had assembled under his banner, and Sir Kennethlittle recked that the display of royal regard consisted in plac-ing him upon a post so perilous. The devotion of his ambi-tious and high-placed affection inflamed his military enthu-siasm. Hopeless as that attachment was in almost any con-ceivable circumstances, those which had lately occurred had,in some degree, diminished the distance between Edith andhimself. He upon whom Richard had conferred the distinc-tion of guarding his banner was no longer an adventurer ofslight note, but placed within the regard of a princess, al-though he was as far as ever from her level. An unknown andobscure fate could not now be his. If he was surprised andslain on the post which had been assigned him, his death?and he resolved it should be glorious?must deserve thepraises as well as call down the vengeance of Coeur de Lion,and be followed by the regrets, and even the tears, of thehigh-born beauties of the English Court. He had now nolonger reason to fear that he should die as a fool dieth.Sir Kenneth had full leisure to enjoy these and similar high-souled thoughts, fostered by that wild spirit of chivalry, which,amid its most extravagant and fantastic flights, was still purefrom all selfish alloy?generous, devoted, and perhaps onlythus far censurable, that it proposed objects and courses ofaction inconsistent with the frailties and imperfections ofman. All nature around him slept in calm moon-shine or indeep shadow. The long rows of tents and pavilions, glim-mering or darkening as they lay in the moonlight or in theshade, were still and silent as the streets of a deserted city.Beside the banner-staff lay the large staghound already men-tioned, the sole companion of Kenneth?s watch, on whosevigilance he trusted for early warning of the approach of anyhostile footstep. The noble animal seemed to understand thepurpose of their watch; for he looked from time to time atthe rich folds of the heavy pennon, and, when the cry of thesentinels came from the distant lines and defences of thecamp, he answered them with one deep and reiterated bark,as if to affirm that he too was vigilant in his duty. From timeto time, also, he lowered his lofty head, and wagged his tail,as his master passed and repassed him in the short turns whichhe took upon his post; or, when the knight stood silent andabstracted leaning on his lance, and looking up towardsheaven, his faithful attendant ventured sometimes, in the 151Sir Walter Scottphrase of romance, ?to disturb his thoughts,? and awakenhim from his reverie, by thrusting his large rough snout intothe knight?s gauntleted hand, to solicit a transitory caress.Thus passed two hours of the knight?s watch without any-thing remarkable occurring. At length, and upon a sudden,the gallant staghound bayed furiously, and seemed about todash forward where the shadow lay the darkest, yet waited, asif in the slips, till he should know the pleasure of his master.?Who goes there?? said Sir Kenneth, aware that there wassomething creeping forward on the shadowy side of themount.?In the name of Merlin and Maugis,? answered a hoarse,disagreeable voice, ?tie up your fourfooted demon there, or Icome not at you.??And who art thou that would approach my post?? said SirKenneth, bending his eyes as keenly as he could on someobject, which he could just observe at the bottom of theascent, without being able to distinguish its form. ?Beware?I am here for death and life.??Take up thy long-fanged Sathanas,? said the voice, ?or Iwill conjure him with a bolt from my arblast.?At the same time was heard the sound of a spring or check,as when a crossbow is bent.?Unbend thy arblast, and come into the moonlight,? saidthe Scot, ?or, by Saint Andrew, I will pin thee to the earth,be what or whom thou wilt!?As he spoke he poised his long lance by the middle, and,fixing his eye upon the object, which seemed to move, hebrandished the weapon, as if meditating to cast it from hishand?a use of the weapon sometimes, though rarely, re-sorted to when a missile was necessary. But Sir Kenneth wasashamed of his purpose, and grounded his weapon, whenthere stepped from the shadow into the moonlight, like anactor entering upon the stage, a stunted, decrepit creature,whom, by his fantastic dress and deformity, he recognized,even at some distance, for the male of the two dwarfs whomhe had seen in the chapel at Engaddi. Recollecting, at thesame moment, the other and far different visions of that ex-traordinary night, he gave his dog a signal, which he instantlyunderstood, and, returning to the standard, laid himself downbeside it with a stifled growl.The little, distorted miniature of humanity, assured of his 152The Talismansafety from an enemy so formidable, came panting up theascent, which the shortness of his legs rendered laborious,and, when he arrived on the platform at the top, shifted tohis left hand the little crossbow, which was just such a toy aschildren at that period were permitted to shoot small birdswith, and, assuming an attitude of great dignity, gracefullyextended his right hand to Sir Kenneth, in an attitude as ifhe expected he would salute it. But such a result not follow-ing, he demanded, in a sharp and angry tone of voice, ?Sol-dier, wherefore renderest thou not to Nectabanus the hom-age due to his dignity? Or is it possible that thou canst haveforgotten him???Great Nectabanus,? answered the knight, willing to soothethe creature?s humour, ?that were difficult for any one whohas ever looked upon thee. Pardon me, however, that, beinga soldier upon my post, with my lance in my hand, I maynot give to one of thy puissance the advantage of comingwithin my guard, or of mastering my weapon. Suffice it thatI reverence thy dignity, and submit myself to thee as humblyas a man-at-arms in my place may.??It shall suffice,? said Nectabanus, ?so that you presentlyattend me to the presence of those who have sent me hitherto summon you.??Great sir,? replied the knight, ?neither in this can I gratifythee, for my orders are to abide by this banner till daybreak?so I Pray you to hold me excused in that matter also.?So saying, he resumed his walk upon the platform; but thedwarf did not suffer him so easily to escape from his impor-tunity.?Look you,? he said, placing himself before Sir Kenneth,so as to interrupt his way, ?either obey me, Sir Knight, as induty bound, or I will lay the command upon thee, in thename of one whose beauty could call down the genii fromtheir sphere, and whose grandeur could command the im-mortal race when they had descended.?A wild and improbable conjecture arose in the knight?s mind,but he repelled it. It was impossible, he thought, that the lady ofhis love should have sent him such a message by such a messen-ger; yet his voice trembled as he said, ?Go to, Nectabanus. Tellme at once, and as a true man, whether this sublime lady ofwhom thou speakest be other than the houri with whose assis-tance I beheld thee sweeping the chapel at Engaddi?? 153Sir Walter Scott?How! presumptuous Knight,? replied the dwarf, ?think?stthou the mistress of our own royal affections, the sharer ofour greatness, and the partner of our comeliness, would de-mean herself by laying charge on such a vassal as thou? No;highly as thou art honoured, thou hast not yet deserved thenotice of Queen Guenevra, the lovely bride of Arthur, fromwhose high seat even princes seem but pigmies. But lookthou here, and as thou knowest or disownest this token, soobey or refuse her commands who hath deigned to imposethem on thee.?So saying, he placed in the knight?s hand a ruby ring, which,even in the moonlight, he had no difficulty to recognize asthat which usually graced the finger of the high-born lady towhose service he had devoted himself. Could he have doubtedthe truth of the token, he would have been convinced by thesmall knot of carnation-coloured ribbon which was fastenedto the ring. This was his lady?s favourite colour, and morethan once had he himself, assuming it for that of his ownliveries, caused the carnation to triumph over all other huesin the lists and in the battle.Sir Kenneth was struck nearly mute by seeing such a tokenin such hands.?In the name of all that is sacred, from whom didst thoureceive this witness?? said the knight. ?Bring, if thou canst,thy wavering understanding to a right settlement for a minuteor two, and tell me the person by whom thou art sent, andthe real purpose of thy message, and take heed what thousayest, for this is no subject for buffoonery.??Fond and foolish Knight,? said the dwarf, ?wouldst thouknow more of this matter than that thou art honoured withcommands from a princess, delivered to thee by a king? Welist not to parley with thee further than to command thee, inthe name and by the power of that ring, to follow us to herwho is the owner of the ring. Every minute that thou tarriestis a crime against thy allegiance.??Good Nectabanus, bethink thyself,? said the knight. ?Canmy lady know where and upon what duty I am this nightengaged? Is she aware that my life?pshaw, why should Ispeak of life?but that my honour depends on my guardingthis banner till daybreak; and can it be her wish that I shouldleave it even to pay homage to her? It is impossible?theprincess is pleased to be merry with her servant in sending 154The Talismanhim such a message; and I must think so the rather that shehath chosen such a messenger.??Oh, keep your belief,? said Nectabanus, turning round asif to leave the platform; ?it is little to me whether you betraitor or true man to this royal lady?so fare thee well.??Stay, stay?I entreat you stay,? said Sir Kenneth. ?Answerme but one question: is the lady who sent thee near to thisplace???What signifies it?? said the dwarf. ?Ought fidelity toreckon furlongs, or miles, or leagues?like the poor courier,who is paid for his labour by the distance which he traverses?Nevertheless, thou soul of suspicion, I tell thee, the fair ownerof the ring now sent to so unworthy a vassal, in whom thereis neither truth nor courage, is not more distant from thisplace than this arblast can send a bolt.?The knight gazed again on that ring, as if to ascertain thatthere was no possible falsehood in the token. ?Tell me,? hesaid to the dwarf, ?is my presence required for any length oftime???Time!? answered Nectabanus, in his flighty manner; ?whatcall you time? I see it not?I feel it not?it is but a shadowyname?a succession of breathings measured forth by nightby the clank of a bell, by day by a shadow crossing along adial-stone. Knowest thou not a true knight?s time shouldonly be reckoned by the deeds that he performs in behalf ofGod and his lady???The words of truth, though in the mouth of folly,? saidthe knight. ?And doth my lady really summon me to somedeed of action, in her name and for her sake??and may itnot be postponed for even the few hours till daybreak???She requires thy presence instantly,? said the dwarf, ?andwithout the loss of so much time as would be told by tengrains of the sandglass. Hearken, thou cold-blooded andsuspicious knight, these are her very words?Tell him thatthe hand which dropped roses can bestow laurels.?This allusion to their meeting in the chapel of Engaddisent a thousand recollections through Sir Kenneth?s brain,and convinced him that the message delivered by the dwarfwas genuine. The rosebuds, withered as they were, were stilltreasured under his cuirass, and nearest to his heart. Hepaused, and could not resolve to forego an opportunity, theonly one which might ever offer, to gain grace in her eyes 155Sir Walter Scottwhom he had installed as sovereign of his affections. Thedwarf, in the meantime, augmented his confusion by insist-ing either that he must return the ring or instantly attendhim.?Hold, hold, yet a moment hold,? said the knight, andproceeded to mutter to himself, ?Am I either the subject orslave of King Richard, more than as a free knight sworn tothe service of the Crusade? And whom have I come hither tohonour with lance and sword? Our holy cause and my tran-scendent lady!??The ring! the ring!? exclaimed the dwarf impatiently; ?falseand slothful knight, return the ring, which thou art unwor-thy to touch or to look upon.??A moment, a moment, good Nectabanus,? said Sir Ken-neth; ?disturb not my thoughts.?What if the Saracens werejust now to attack our lines? Should I stay here like a swornvassal of England, watching that her king?s pride suffered nohumiliation; or should I speed to the breach, and fight forthe Cross? To the breach, assuredly; and next to the cause ofGod come the commands of my liege lady. And yet, Coeurde Lion?s behest?my own promise! Nectabanus, I conjurethee once more to say, are you to conduct me far from hence???But to yonder pavilion; and, since you must needs know,?replied Nectabanus, ?the moon is glimmering on the gilded ballwhich crowns its roof, and which is worth a king?s ransom.??I can return in an instant,? said the knight, shutting hiseyes desperately to all further consequences, ?I can hear fromthence the bay of my dog if any one approaches the stan-dard. I will throw myself at my lady?s feet, and pray her leaveto return to conclude my watch.?Here, Roswal? (callinghis hound, and throwing down his mantle by the side of thestandard-spear), ?watch thou here, and let no one approach.?The majestic dog looked in his master?s face, as if to be surethat he understood his charge, then sat down beside the mantle,with ears erect and head raised, like a sentinel, understandingperfectly the purpose for which he was stationed there.?Come now, good Nectabanus,? said the knight, ?let ushasten to obey the commands thou hast brought.??Haste he that will,? said the dwarf sullenly; ?thou hastnot been in haste to obey my summons, nor can I walk fastenough to follow your long strides?you do not walk like aman, but bound like an ostrich in the desert.? 156The TalismanThere were but two ways of conquering the obstinacy ofNectabanus, who, as he spoke, diminished his walk into asnail?s pace. For bribes Sir Kenneth had no means?for sooth-ing no time; so in his impatience he snatched the dwarf upfrom the ground, and bearing him along, notwithstandinghis entreaties and his fear, reached nearly to the pavilionpointed out as that of the Queen. In approaching it, how-ever, the Scot observed there was a small guard of soldierssitting on the ground, who had been concealed from him bythe intervening tents. Wondering that the clash of his ownarmour had not yet attracted their attention, and supposingthat his motions might, on the present occasion, require tobe conducted with secrecy, he placed the little panting guideupon the ground to recover his breath, and point out whatwas next to be done, Nectabanus was both frightened andangry; but he had felt himself as completely in the power ofthe robust knight as an owl in the claws of an eagle, andtherefore cared not to provoke him to any further display ofhis strength.He made no complaints, therefore, of the usage he hadreceived; but, turning amongst the labyrinth of tents, he ledthe knight in silence to the opposite side of the pavilion,which thus screened them from the observation of the ward-ers, who seemed either too negligent or too sleepy to dis-charge their duty with much accuracy. Arrived there, thedwarf raised the under part of the canvas from the ground,and made signs to Sir Kenneth that he should introduce him-self to the inside of the tent, by creeping under it. The knighthesitated. There seemed an indecorum in thus privately in-troducing himself into a pavilion pitched, doubtless, for theaccommodation of noble ladies; but he recalled to remem-brance the assured tokens which the dwarf had exhibited,and concluded that it was not for him to dispute his lady?spleasure.He stooped accordingly, crept beneath the canvas enclo-sure of the tent, and heard the dwarf whisper from without,?Remain here until I call thee.? 157Sir Walter ScottCHAPTER XIII.You talk of Gaiety and Innocence!The moment when the fatal fruit was eaten,They parted ne?er to meet again; and MaliceHas ever since been playmate to light Gaiety,From the first moment when the smiling infantDestroys the flower or butterfly he toys with,To the last chuckle of the dying miser,Who on his deathbed laughs his last to hearHis wealthy neighbour has become a bankrupt.Old Play.SIR KENNETH was left for some minutes alone and in dark-ness. Here was another interruption which must prolong hisabsence from his post, and he began almost to repent thefacility with which he had been induced to quit it. But toreturn without seeing the Lady Edith was now not to bethought of. He had committed a breach of military disci-pline, and was determined at least to prove the reality of theseductive expectations which had tempted him to do so.Meanwhile his situation was unpleasant. There was no lightto show him into what sort of apartment he had been led?the Lady Edith was in immediate attendance on the Queenof England?and the discovery of his having introduced him-self thus furtively into the royal pavilion might, were it dis-covered; lead to much and dangerous suspicion. While hegave way to these unpleasant reflections, and began almostto wish that he could achieve his retreat unobserved, he hearda noise of female voices, laughing, whispering, and speak-ing, in an adjoining apartment, from which, as the soundsgave him reason to judge, he could only be separated by acanvas partition. Lamps were burning, as he might perceiveby the shadowy light which extended itself even to his sideof the veil which divided the tent, and he could see shades ofseveral figures sitting and moving in the adjoining apartment.It cannot be termed discourtesy in Sir Kenneth that, situ-ated as he was, he overheard a conversation in which he foundhimself deeply interested.?Call her?call her, for Our Lady?s sake,? said the voice ofone of these laughing invisibles. ?Nectabanus, thou shalt be 158The Talismanmade ambassador to Prester John?s court, to show them howwisely thou canst discharge thee of a mission.?The shrill tone of the dwarf was heard, yet so much sub-dued that Sir Kenneth could not understand what he said,except that he spoke something of the means of merrimentgiven to the guard.?But how shall we rid us of the spirit which Nectabanushath raised, my maidens???Hear me, royal madam,? said another voice. ?If the sageand princely Nectabanus be not over-jealous of his most tran-scendent bride and empress, let us send her to get us rid ofthis insolent knight-errant, who can be so easily persuadedthat high-born dames may need the use of his insolent andoverweening valour.??It were but justice, methinks,? replied another, ?that thePrincess Guenever should dismiss, by her courtesy, him whomher husband?s wisdom has been able to entice hither.?Struck to the heart with shame and resentment at what hehad heard, Sir Kenneth was about to attempt his escape fromthe tent at all hazards, when what followed arrested his pur-pose.?Nay, truly,? said the first speaker, ?our cousin Edith mustfirst learn how this vaunted wight hath conducted himself,and we must reserve the power of giving her ocular proofthat he hath failed in his duty. It may be a lesson will dogood upon her; for, credit me, Calista, I have sometimesthought she has let this Northern adventurer sit nearer herheart than prudence would sanction.?One of the other voices was then heard to mutter some-thing of the Lady Edith?s prudence and wisdom.?Prudence, wench!? was the reply. ?It is mere pride, and thedesire to be thought more rigid than any of us. Nay, I will notquit my advantage. You know well that when she has us atfault no one can, in a civil way, lay your error before you moreprecisely than can my Lady Edith. But here she comes.?A figure, as if entering the apartment, cast upon the parti-tion a shade, which glided along slowly until it mixed withthose which already clouded it. Despite of the bitter disap-pointment which he had experienced?despite the insult andinjury with which it seemed he had been visited by the mal-ice, or, at best, by the idle humour of Queen Berengaria (forhe already concluded that she who spoke loudest, and in a 159Sir Walter Scottcommanding tone, was the wife of Richard), the knight feltsomething so soothing to his feelings in learning that Edithhad been no partner to the fraud practised on him, and sointeresting to his curiosity in the scene which was about totake place, that, instead of prosecuting his more prudentpurpose of an instant retreat, he looked anxiously, on thecontrary, for some rent or crevice by means of which be mightbe made eye as well as ear witness to what was to go forward.?Surely,? said he to himself, ?the Queen, who hath beenpleased for an idle frolic to endanger my reputation, andperhaps my life, cannot complain if I avail myself of thechance which fortune seems willing to afford me to obtainknowledge of her further intentions.?It seemed, in the meanwhile, as if Edith were waiting forthe commands of the Queen, and as if the other were reluc-tant to speak for fear of being unable to command her laugh-ter and that of her companions; for Sir Kenneth could onlydistinguish a sound as of suppressed tittering and merriment.?Your Majesty,? said Edith at last, ?seems in a merry mood,though, methinks, the hour of night prompts a sleepy one. Iwas well disposed bedward when I had your Majesty?s com-mands to attend you.??I will not long delay you, cousin, from your repose,? saidthe Queen, ?though I fear you will sleep less soundly when Itell you your wager is lost.??Nay, royal madam,? said Edith, ?this, surely, is dwellingon a jest which has rather been worn out, I laid no wager,however it was your Majesty?s pleasure to suppose, or to in-sist, that I did so.??Nay, now, despite our pilgrimage, Satan is strong withyou, my gentle cousin, and prompts thee to leasing. Canyou deny that you gaged your ruby ring against my goldenbracelet that yonder Knight of the Libbard, or how call youhim, could not be seduced from his post???Your Majesty is too great for me to gainsay you,? repliedEdith, ?but these ladies can, if they will, bear me witness thatit was your Highness who proposed such a wager, and tookthe ring from my finger, even while I was declaring that I didnot think it maidenly to gage anything on such a subject.??Nay, but, my Lady Edith,? said another voice, ?you mustneeds grant, under your favour, that you expressed yourself veryconfident of the valour of that same Knight of the Leopard.? 160The Talisman?And if I did, minion,? said Edith angrily, ?is that a goodreason why thou shouldst put in thy word to flatter herMajesty?s humour? I spoke of that knight but as all men speakwho have seen him in the field, and had no more interest indefending than thou in detracting from him. In a camp, whatcan women speak of save soldiers and deeds of arms???The noble Lady Edith,? said a third voice, ?hath neverforgiven Calista and me, since we told your Majesty that shedropped two rosebuds in the chapel.??If your Majesty,? said Edith, in a tone which Sir Kennethcould judge to be that of respectful remonstrance, ?have noother commands for me than to hear the gibes of your wait-ing-women, I must crave your permission to withdraw.??Silence, Florise,? said the Queen, ?and let not our indul-gence lead you to forget the difference betwixt yourself andthe kinswoman of England.?But you, my dear cousin,? shecontinued, resuming her tone of raillery, ?how can you, whoare so good-natured, begrudge us poor wretches a few min-utes? laughing, when we have had so many days devoted toweeping and gnashing of teeth???Great be your mirth, royal lady,? said Edith; ?yet would Ibe content not to smile for the rest of my life, rather than??She stopped, apparently out of respect; but Sir Kennethcould hear that she was in much agitation.?Forgive me,? said Berengaria, a thoughtless but good-humoured princess of the House of Navarre; ?but what isthe great offence, after all? A young knight has been wiledhither?has stolen, or has been stolen, from his post, whichno one will disturb in his absence?for the sake of a fairlady; for, to do your champion justice, sweet one, the wis-dom of Nectabanus could conjure him hither in no namebut yours.??Gracious Heaven! your Majesty does not say so?? saidEdith, in a voice of alarm quite different from the agitationshe had previously evinced,??you cannot say so consistentlywith respect for your own honour and for mine, yourhusband?s kinswoman! Say you were jesting with me, myroyal mistress, and forgive me that I could, even for a mo-ment, think it possible you could be in earnest!??The Lady Edith,? said the Queen, in a displeased tone ofvoice, ?regrets the ring we have won of her. We will restorethe pledge to you, gentle cousin; only you must not grudge 161Sir Walter Scottus in turn a little triumph over the wisdom which has beenso often spread over us, as a banner over a host.??A triumph!? exclaimed Edith indignantly??a triumph!The triumph will be with the infidel, when he hears that theQueen of England can make the reputation of her husband?skinswoman the subject of a light frolic.??You are angry, fair cousin, at losing your favourite ring,?said the Queen. ?Come, since you grudge to pay your wa-ger, we will renounce our right; it was your name and thatpledge brought him hither, and we care not for the bait afterthe fish is caught.??Madam,? replied Edith impatiently, ?you know well thatyour Grace could not wish for anything of mine but it be-comes instantly yours. But I would give a bushel of rubiesere ring or name of mine had been used to bring a braveman into a fault, and perhaps to disgrace and punishment.??Oh, it is for the safety of our true knight that we fear!?said the Queen. ?You rate our power too low, fair cousin,when you speak of a life being lost for a frolic of ours. OLady Edith, others have influence on the iron breasts of war-riors as well as you?the heart even of a lion is made of flesh,not of stone; and, believe me, I have interest enough withRichard to save this knight, in whose fate Lady Edith is sodeeply concerned, from the penalty of disobeying his royalcommands.??For the love of the blessed Cross, most royal lady,? saidEdith?and Sir Kenneth, with feelings which it were hard tounravel, heard her prostrate herself at the Queen?s feet??forthe love of our blessed Lady, and of every holy saint in thecalendar, beware what you do! You know not King Rich-ard?you have been but shortly wedded to him. Your breathmight as well combat the west wind when it is wildest, asyour words persuade my royal kinsman to pardon a militaryoffence. Oh, for God?s sake, dismiss this gentleman, if in-deed you have lured him hither! I could almost be contentto rest with the shame of having invited him, did I knowthat he was returned again where his duty calls him!??Arise, cousin, arise,? said Queen Berengaria, ?and be as-sured all will be better than you think. Rise, dear Edith. I amsorry I have played my foolery with a knight in whom youtake such deep interest. Nay, wring not thy hands; I willbelieve thou carest not for him?believe anything rather than 162The Talismansee thee look so wretchedly miserable. I tell thee I will takethe blame on myself with King Richard in behalf of thy fairNorthern friend?thine acquaintance, I would say, since thouown?st him not as a friend. Nay, look not so reproachfully.We will send Nectabanus to dismiss this Knight of the Stan-dard to his post; and we ourselves will grace him on somefuture day, to make amends for his wild-goose chase. He is,I warrant, but lying perdu in some neighbouring tent.??By my crown of lilies, and my sceptre of a specially goodwater-reed,? said Nectabanus, ?your Majesty is mistaken, Heis nearer at hand than you wot?he lieth ensconced therebehind that canvas partition.??And within hearing of each word we have said!? exclaimedthe Queen, in her turn violently surprised and agitated. ?Out,monster of folly and malignity!?As she uttered these words, Nectabanus fled from the pa-vilion with a yell of such a nature as leaves it still doubtfulwhether Berengaria had confined her rebuke to words, oradded some more emphatic expression of her displeasure.?What can now be done?? said the Queen to Edith, in awhisper of undisguised uneasiness.?That which must,? said Edith firmly. ?We must see thisgentleman and place ourselves in his mercy.?So saying, she began hastily to undo a curtain, which atone place covered an entrance or communication.?For Heaven?s sake, forbear?consider,? said the Queen??my apartment?our dress?the hour?my honour!?But ere she could detail her remonstrances, the curtain fell,and there was no division any longer betwixt the armed knightand the party of ladies. The warmth of an Eastern night oc-casioned the undress of Queen Berengaria and her house-hold to be rather more simple and unstudied than their sta-tion, and the presence of a male spectator of rank, required.This the Queen remembered, and with a loud shriek fledfrom the apartment where Sir Kenneth was disclosed to viewin a compartment of the ample pavilion, now no longer sepa-rated from that in which they stood. The grief and agitationof the Lady Edith, as well as the deep interest she felt in ahasty explanation with the Scottish knight, perhaps occa-sioned her forgetting that her locks were more dishevelledand her person less heedfully covered than was the wont ofhigh-born damsels, in an age which was not, after all, the 163Sir Walter Scottmost prudish or scrupulous period of the ancient time. Athin, loose garment of pink-coloured silk made the principalpart of her vestments, with Oriental slippers, into which shehad hastily thrust her bare feet, and a scarf hurriedly andloosely thrown about her shoulders. Her head had no othercovering than the veil of rich and dishevelled locks fallinground it on every side, that half hid a countenance which amingled sense of modesty and of resentment, and other deepand agitated feelings, had covered with crimson.But although Edith felt her situation with all that delicacywhich is her sex?s greatest charm, it did not seem that for amoment she placed her own bashfulness in comparison withthe duty which, as she thought, she owed to him who hadbeen led into error and danger on her account. She drew,indeed, her scarf more closely over her neck and bosom, andshe hastily laid from her hand a lamp which shed too muchlustre over her figure; but, while Sir Kenneth stood motion-less on the same spot in which he was first discovered, sherather stepped towards than retired from him, as she ex-claimed, ?Hasten to your post, valiant knight!?you are de-ceived in being trained hither?ask no questions.??I need ask none,? said the knight, sinking upon one knee,with the reverential devotion of a saint at the altar, and bend-ing his eyes on the ground, lest his looks should increase thelady?s embarrassment.?Have you heard all?? said Edith impatiently. ?Gracioussaints! then wherefore wait you here, when each minute thatpasses is loaded with dishonour!??I have heard that I am dishonoured, lady, and I have heardit from you,? answered Kenneth. ?What reck I how soonpunishment follows? I have but one petition to you; andthen I seek, among the sabres of the infidels, whetherdishonour may not be washed out with blood.??Do not so, neither,? said the lady. ?Be wise?dally nothere; all may yet be well, if you will but use dispatch.??I wait but for your forgiveness,? said the knight, still kneel-ing, ?for my presumption in believing that my poor servicescould have been required or valued by you.??I do forgive you?oh, I have nothing to forgive! have beenthe means of injuring you. But oh, begone! I will forgive?Iwill value you?that is, as I value every brave Crusader?ifyou will but begone!? 164The Talisman?Receive, first, this precious yet fatal pledge,? said theknight, tendering the ring to Edith, who now showed ges-tures of impatience.?Oh, no, no ? she said, declining to receive it. ?Keep it?keep it as a mark of my regard?my regret, I would say. Oh,begone, if not for your own sake, for mine!?Almost recompensed for the loss even of honour, whichher voice had denounced to him, by the interest which sheseemed to testify in his safety, Sir Kenneth rose from hisknee, and, casting a momentary glance on Edith, bowed low,and seemed about to withdraw. At the same instant, thatmaidenly bashfulness, which the energy of Edith?s feelingshad till then triumphed over, became conqueror in its turn,and she hastened from the apartment, extinguishing her lampas she went, and leaving, in Sir Kenneth?s thoughts, bothmental and natural gloom behind her.She must be obeyed, was the first distinct idea which wakedhim from his reverie, and he hastened to the place by whichhe had entered the pavilion. To pass under the canvas in themanner he had entered required time and attention, and hemade a readier aperture by slitting the canvas wall with hisponiard. When in the free air, he felt rather stupefied andoverpowered by a conflict of sensations, than able to ascer-tain what was the real import of the whole. He was obligedto spur himself to action by recollecting that the commandsof the Lady Edith had required haste. Even then, engaged ashe was amongst tent-ropes and tents, he was compelled tomove with caution until he should regain the path or av-enue, aside from which the dwarf had led him, in order toescape the observation of the guards before the Queen?s pa-vilion; and he was obliged also to move slowly, and withprecaution, to avoid giving an alarm, either by falling or bythe clashing of his armour. A thin cloud had obscured themoon, too, at the very instant of his leaving the tent, and SirKenneth had to struggle with this inconvenience at a mo-ment when the dizziness of his head and the fullness of hisheart scarce left him powers of intelligence sufficient to di-rect his motions.But at once sounds came upon his ear which instantly re-called him to the full energy of his faculties. These proceededfrom the Mount of Saint George. He heard first a single,fierce, angry, and savage bark, which was immediately fol- 165Sir Walter Scottlowed by a yell of agony. No deer ever bounded with a wilderstart at the voice of Roswal than did Sir Kenneth at what hefeared was the death-cry of that noble hound, from whomno ordinary injury could have extracted even the slightestacknowledgment of pain. He surmounted the space whichdivided him from the avenue, and, having attained it, beganto run towards the mount, although loaded with his mail,faster than most men could have accompanied him even ifunarmed, relaxed not his pace for the steep sides of the arti-ficial mound, and in a few minutes stood on the platformupon its summit.The moon broke forth at this moment, and showed himthat the Standard of England was vanished, that the spearon which it had floated lay broken on the ground, and be-side it was his faithful hound, apparently in the agonies ofdeath.CHAPTER XIV.All my long arrear of honour lost,Heap?d up in youth, and hoarded up for age.Hath Honour?s fountain then suck?d up the stream?He hath?and hooting boys may barefoot pass,And gather pebbles from the naked ford!Don Sebastian.AFTER A TORRENT of afflicting sensations, by which he was atfirst almost stunned and confounded, Sir Kenneth?s firstthought was to look for the authors of this violation of theEnglish banner; but in no direction could he see traces ofthem. His next, which to some persons, but scarce to anywho have made intimate acquaintances among the caninerace, may appear strange, was to examine the condition ofhis faithful Roswal, mortally wounded, as it seemed, in dis-charging the duty which his master had been seduced toabandon. He caressed the dying animal, who, faithful to thelast, seemed to forget his own pain in the satisfaction he re- 166The Talismanceived from his master?s presence, and continued wagginghis tail and licking his hand, even while by low moanings heexpressed that his agony was increased by the attempts whichSir Kenneth made to withdraw from the wound the frag-ment of the lance or javelin with which it had been inflicted;then redoubled his feeble endearments, as if fearing he hadoffended his master by showing a sense of the pain to whichhis interference had subjected him. There was something inthe display of the dying creature?s attachment which mixedas a bitter ingredient with the sense of disgrace and desola-tion by which Sir Kenneth was oppressed. His only friendseemed removed from him, just when he had incurred thecontempt and hatred of all besides. The knight?s strength ofmind gave way to a burst of agonized distress, and he groanedand wept aloud.While he thus indulged his grief, a clear and solemn voice,close beside him, pronounced these words in the sonoroustone of the readers of the mosque, and in the lingua francamutually understood by Christians and Saracens:??Adversity is like the period of the former and of the latterrain?cold, comfortless, unfriendly to man and to animal;yet from that season have their birth the flower and the fruit,the date, the rose, and the pomegranate.?Sir Kenneth of the Leopard turned towards the speaker,and beheld the Arabian physician, who, approaching un-heard, had seated himself a little behind him cross-legged,and uttered with gravity, yet not without a tone of sympa-thy, the moral sentences of consolation with which the Ko-ran and its commentators supplied him; for, in the East, wis-dom is held to consist less in a display of the sage?s owninventive talents, than in his ready memory and happy ap-plication of and reference to ?that which is written.?Ashamed at being surprised in a womanlike expression ofsorrow, Sir Kenneth dashed his tears indignantly aside, andagain busied himself with his dying favourite.?The poet hath said,? continued the Arab, without notic-ing the knight?s averted looks and sullen deportment, ?theox for the field, and the camel for the desert. Were not thehand of the leech fitter than that of the soldier to cure wounds,though less able to inflict them???This patient, Hakim, is beyond thy help,? said Sir Ken-neth; ?and, besides, he is, by thy law, an unclean animal.? 167Sir Walter Scott?Where Allah hath deigned to bestow life, and a sense ofpain and pleasure,? said the physician, ?it were sinful prideshould the sage, whom He has enlightened, refuse to pro-long existence or assuage agony. To the sage, the cure of amiserable groom, of a poor dog and of a conquering mon-arch, are events of little distinction. Let me examine thiswounded animal.?Sir Kenneth acceded in silence, and the physician inspectedand handled Roswal?s wound with as much care and atten-tion as if he had been a human being. He then took forth acase of instruments, and, by the judicious and skilful appli-cation of pincers, withdrew from the wounded shoulder thefragment of the weapon, and stopped with styptics and ban-dages the effusion of blood which followed; the creature allthe while suffering him patiently to perform these kind of-fices, as if he had been aware of his kind intentions.?The animal may be cured,? said El Hakim, addressinghimself to Sir Kenneth, ?if you will permit me to carry himto my tent, and treat him with the care which the noblenessof his nature deserves. For know, that thy servant Adonbec isno less skilful in the race and pedigree and distinctions ofgood dogs and of noble steeds than in the diseases whichafflict the human race.??Take him with you,? said the knight. ?I bestow him onyou freely, if he recovers. I owe thee a reward for attendanceon my squire, and have nothing else to pay it with. For my-self, I will never again wind bugle or halloo to hound!?The Arabian made no reply, but gave a signal with a clap-ping of his hands, which was instantly answered by the ap-pearance of two black slaves. He gave them his orders inArabic, received the answer that ?to hear was to obey,? when,taking the animal in their arms, they removed him, withoutmuch resistance on his part; for though his eyes turned tohis master, he was too weak to struggle.?Fare thee well, Roswal, then,? said Sir Kenneth??fare theewell, my last and only friend?thou art too noble a possessionto be retained by one such as I must in future call myself!?Iwould,? he said, as the slaves retired, ?that, dying as he is, Icould exchange conditions with that noble animal!??It is written,? answered the Arabian, although the excla-mation had not been addressed to him, ?that all creatures arefashioned for the service of man; and the master of the earth 168The Talismanspeaketh folly when he would exchange, in his impatience,his hopes here and to come for the servile condition of aninferior being.??A dog who dies in discharging his duty,? said the knightsternly, ?is better than a man who survives the desertion ofit. Leave me, Hakim; thou hast, on this side of miracle, themost wonderful science which man ever possessed, but thewounds of the spirit are beyond thy power.??Not if the patient will explain his calamity, and be guidedby the physician,? said Adonbec el Hakim.?Know, then,? said Sir Kenneth, ?since thou art so impor-tunate, that last night the Banner of England was displayedfrom this mound?I was its appointed guardian?morningis now breaking?there lies the broken banner-spear, the stan-dard itself is lost, and here sit I a living man!??How!? said El Hakim, examining him; ?thy armour iswhole?there is no blood on thy weapons, and report speaksthee one unlikely to return thus from fight. Thou hast beentrained from thy post?ay, trained by the rosy cheek andblack eye of one of those houris, to whom you Nazarenesvow rather such service as is due to Allah, than such love asmay lawfully be rendered to forms of clay like our own. Ithas been thus assuredly; for so hath man ever fallen, evensince the days of Sultan Adam.??And if it were so, physician,? said Sir Kenneth sullenly,?what remedy???Knowledge is the parent of power,? said El Hakim, ?as valoursupplies strength. Listen to me. Man is not as a tree, bound toone spot of earth; nor is he framed to cling to one bare rock,like the scarce animated shell-fish. Thine own Christian writ-ings command thee, when persecuted in one city, to flee toanother; and we Moslem also know that Mohammed, theProphet of Allah, driven forth from the holy city of Mecca,found his refuge and his helpmates at Medina.??And what does this concern me?? said the Scot.?Much,? answered the physician. ?Even the sage flies thetempest which he cannot control. Use thy speed, therefore,and fly from the vengeance of Richard to the shadow ofSaladin?s victorious banner.??I might indeed hide my dishonour,? said Sir Kennethironically, ?in a camp of infidel heathens, where the veryphrase is unknown. But had I not better partake more fully 169Sir Walter Scottin their reproach? Does not thy advice stretch so far as torecommend me to take the turban? Methinks I want butapostasy to consummate my infamy.??Blaspheme not, Nazarene,? said the physician sternly.?Saladin makes no converts to the law of the Prophet, savethose on whom its precepts shall work conviction. Open thineeyes to the light, and the great Soldan, whose liberality is asboundless as his power, may bestow on thee a kingdom; re-main blinded if thou will, and, being one whose second lifeis doomed to misery, Saladin will yet, for this span of presenttime, make thee rich and happy. But fear not that thy browsshall be bound with the turban, save at thine own free choice.??My choice were rather,? said the knight, ?that my writhenfeatures should blacken, as they are like to do, in this evening?ssetting sun.??Yet thou art not wise, Nazarene,? said El Hakim, ?to rejectthis fair offer; for I have power with Saladin, and can raisethee high in his grace. Look you, my son?this Crusade, asyou call your wild enterprise, is like a large dromond [Thelargest sort of vessels then known were termed dromond?s, ordromedaries.] parting asunder in the waves. Thou thyself hastborne terms of truce from the kings and princes, whose forceis here assembled, to the mighty Soldan, and knewest not,perchance, the full tenor of thine own errand.??I knew not, and I care not,? said the knight impatiently.?What avails it to me that I have been of late the envoy ofprinces, when, ere night, I shall be a gibbeted anddishonoured corse???Nay, I speak that it may not be so with thee,? said thephysician. ?Saladin is courted on all sides. The combinedprinces of this league formed against him have made suchproposals of composition and peace, as, in other circum-stances, it might have become his honour to have granted tothem. Others have made private offers, on their own sepa-rate account, to disjoin their forces from the camp of theKings of Frangistan, and even to lend their arms to the de-fence of the standard of the Prophet. But Saladin will not beserved by such treacherous and interested defection. The kingof kings will treat only with the Lion King. Saladin will holdtreaty with none but the Melech Ric, and with him he willtreat like a prince, or fight like a champion. To Richard hewill yield such conditions of his free liberality as the swords 170The Talismanof all Europe could never compel from him by force or ter-ror. He will permit a free pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and all theplaces where the Nazarenes list to worship; nay, he will so farshare even his empire with his brother Richard, that be willallow Christian garrisons in the six strongest cities of Pales-tine, and one in Jerusalem itself, and suffer them to be underthe immediate command of the officers of Richard, who, heconsents, shall bear the name of King Guardian of Jerusa-lem. Yet further, strange and incredible as you may think it,know, Sir Knight?for to your honour I can commit eventhat almost incredible secret?know that Saladin will put asacred seal on this happy union betwixt the bravest and no-blest of Frangistan and Asia, by raising to the rank of hisroyal spouse a Christian damsel, allied in blood to King Ri-chard, and known by the name of the Lady Edith ofPlantagenet.? [This may appear so extraordinary and im-probable a proposition that it is necessary to say such a onewas actually made. The historians, however, substitute thewidowed Queen of Naples, sister of Richard, for the bride,and Saladin?s brother for the bridegroom. They appear tohave been ignorant of the existence of Edith of Plantagenet.?See Mill?s History of the Crusades, vol. ii., p. 61.]?Ha!?sayest thou?? exclaimed Sir Kenneth, who, listeningwith indifference and apathy to the preceding part of ElHakim?s speech, was touched by this last communication, asthe thrill of a nerve, unexpectedly jarred, will awaken the sen-sation of agony, even in the torpor of palsy. Then, moderatinghis tone, by dint of much effort he restrained his indignation,and, veiling it under the appearance of contemptuous doubt,he prosecuted the conversation, in order to get as much knowl-edge as possible of the plot, as he deemed it, against the honourand happiness of her whom he loved not the less that his pas-sion had ruined, apparently, his fortunes, at once, and hishonour.??And what Christian,? he said, With tolerable calm-ness, ?would sanction a union so unnatural as that of a Chris-tian maiden with an unbelieving Saracen???Thou art but an ignorant, bigoted Nazarene,? said theHakim. ?Seest thou not how the Mohammedan princes dailyintermarry with the noble Nazarene maidens in Spain, with-out scandal either to Moor or Christian? And the nobleSoldan will, in his full confidence in the blood of Richard,permit the English maid the freedom which your Frankish 171Sir Walter Scottmanners have assigned to women. He will allow her the freeexercise of her religion, seeing that, in very truth, it signifiesbut little to which faith females are addicted; and he willassign her such place and rank over all the women of hiszenana, that she shall be in every respect his sole and abso-lute queen.??What!? said Sir Kenneth, ?darest thou think, Moslem,that Richard would give his kinswoman?a high-born andvirtuous princess?to be, at best, the foremost concubine inthe haram of a misbeliever? Know, Hakim, the meanest freeChristian noble would scorn, on his child?s behalf, such splen-did ignominy.??Thou errest,? said the Hakim. ?Philip of France, andHenry of Champagne, and others of Richard?s principal al-lies, have heard the proposal without starting, and have prom-ised, as far as they may, to forward an alliance that may endthese wasteful wars; and the wise arch-priest of Tyre hathundertaken to break the proposal to Richard, not doubtingthat he shall be able to bring the plan to good issue. TheSoldan?s wisdom hath as yet kept his proposition secret fromothers, such as he of Montserrat, and the Master of theTemplars, because he knows they seek to thrive by Richard?sdeath or disgrace, not by his life or honour. Up, therefore,Sir Knight, and to horse. I will give thee a scroll which shalladvance thee highly with the Soldan; and deem not that youare leaving your country, or her cause, or her religion, sincethe interest of the two monarchs will speedily be the same.To Saladin thy counsel will be most acceptable, since thoucanst make him aware of much concerning the marriages ofthe Christians, the treatment of their wives, and other pointsof their laws and usages, which, in the course of such treaty,it much concerns him that he should know. The right handof the Soldan grasps the treasures of the East, and it is thefountain or generosity. Or, if thou desirest it, Saladin, whenallied with England, can have but little difficulty to obtainfrom Richard, not only thy pardon and restoration to favour,but an honourable command in the troops which may beleft of the King of England?s host, to maintain their jointgovernment in Palestine. Up, then, and mount?there lies aplain path before thee.??Hakim,? said the Scottish knight, ?thou art a man of peace;also thou hast saved the life of Richard of England?and, 172The Talismanmoreover, of my own poor esquire, Strauchan. I have, there-fore, heard to an end a matter which, being propounded byanother Moslem than thyself, I would have cut short with ablow of my dagger! Hakim, in return for thy kindness, Iadvise thee to see that the Saracen who shall propose to Ri-chard a union betwixt the blood of Plantagenet and that ofhis accursed race do put on a helmet which is capable toendure such a blow of a battle-axe as that which struck downthe gate of Acre. Certes, he will be otherwise placed beyondthe reach even of thy skill.??Thou art, then, wilfully determined not to fly to theSaracen host?? said the physician. ?Yet, remember, thoustayest to certain destruction; and the writings of thy law, aswell as ours, prohibit man from breaking into the tabernacleof his own life.??God forbid!? replied the Scot, crossing himself; ?but weare also forbidden to avoid the punishment which our crimeshave deserved. And since so poor are thy thoughts of fidel-ity, Hakim, it grudges me that I have bestowed my goodhound on thee, for, should he live, he will have a masterignorant of his value.??A gift that is begrudged is already recalled,? said El Hakim;?only we physicians are sworn not to send away a patientuncured. If the dog recover, he is once more yours.??Go to, Hakim,? answered Sir Kenneth; ?men speak notof hawk and hound when there is but an hour of day-break-ing betwixt them and death. Leave me to recollect my sins,and reconcile myself to Heaven.??I leave thee in thine obstinacy,? said the physician; ?themist hides the precipice from those who are doomed to fallover it.?He withdrew slowly, turning from time to time his head,as if to observe whether the devoted knight might not recallhim either by word or signal. At last his turbaned figure waslost among the labyrinth of tents which lay extended be-neath, whitening in the pale light of the dawning, beforewhich the moonbeam had now faded away.But although the physician Adonbec?s words had not madethat impression upon Kenneth which the sage desired, theyhad inspired the Scot with a motive for desiring life, which,dishonoured as he conceived himself to be, he was beforewilling to part from as from a sullied vestment no longer 173Sir Walter Scottbecoming his wear. Much that had passed betwixt himselfand the hermit, besides what he had observed between theanchorite and Sheerkohf (or Ilderim), he now recalled torecollection, and tended to confirm what the Hakim hadtold him of the secret article of the treaty.?The reverend impostor!? he exclaimed to himself; ?thehoary hypocrite! He spoke of the unbelieving husband con-verted by the believing wife; and what do I know but thatthe traitor exhibited to the Saracen, accursed of God, thebeauties of Edith Plantagenet, that the hound might judge ifthe princely Christian lady were fit to be admitted into theharam of a misbeliever? If I had yonder infidel Ilderim, orwhatsoever he is called, again in the gripe with which I onceheld him fast as ever hound held hare, never again should heat least come on errand disgraceful to the honour of Chris-tian king or noble and virtuous maiden. But I?my hoursare fast dwindling into minutes?yet, while I have life andbreath, something must be done, and speedily.?He paused for a few minutes, threw from him his helmet,then strode down the hill, and took the road to King Richard?spavilion.CHAPTER XV.The feather?d songster, chanticleer,Had wound his bugle-horn,And told the early villagerThe coming of the morn.King Edward saw the ruddy streaksOf light eclipse the grey,And heard the raven?s croaking throatProclaim the fated day.?Thou?rt right,? he said, ?for, by the GodThat sits enthron?d on high,Charles Baldwin, and his fellows twain,This day shall surely die.?Chatterton.ON THE EVENING on which Sir Kenneth assumed his post,Richard, after the stormy event which disturbed its tranquil-lity, had retired to rest in the plenitude of confidence in-spired by his unbounded courage and the superiority which 174The Talismanhe had displayed in carrying the point he aimed at in pres-ence of the whole Christian host and its leaders, many ofwhom, he was aware, regarded in their secret souls the dis-grace of the Austrian Duke as a triumph over themselves; sothat his pride felt gratified, that in prostrating one enemy hehad mortified a hundred.Another monarch would have doubled his guards on theevening after such a scene, and kept at least a part of histroops under arms. But Coeur de Lion dismissed, upon theoccasion, even his ordinary watch, and assigned to his sol-diers a donative of wine to cerebrate his recovery, and todrink to the Banner of Saint George; and his quarter of thecamp would have assumed a character totally devoid of vigi-lance and military preparation, but that Sir Thomas de Vaux,the Earl of Salisbury, and other nobles, took precautions topreserve order and discipline among the revellers.The physician attended the King from his retiring to bedtill midnight was past, and twice administered medicine tohim during that period, always previously observing the quar-ter of heaven occupied by the full moon, whose influenceshe declared to be most sovereign, or most baleful, to theeffect of his drugs. It was three hours after midnight ere ElHakim withdrew from the royal tent, to one which had beenpitched for himself and his retinue. In his way thither hevisited the tent of Sir Kenneth of the Leopard, in order tosee the condition of his first patient in the Christian camp,old Strauchan, as the knight?s esquire was named. Inquiringthere for Sir Kenneth himself, El Hakim learned on whatduty he was employed, and probably this information ledhim to Saint George?s Mount, where he found him whomhe sought in the disastrous circumstances alluded to in thelast chapter.It was about the hour of sunrise, when a slow, armed treadwas heard approaching the King?s pavilion; and ere De Vaux,who slumbered beside his master?s bed as lightly as ever sleepsat upon the eyes of a watch-dog, had time to do more thanarise and say, ?Who comes?? the Knight of the Leopard en-tered the tent, with a deep and devoted gloom seated uponhis manly features.?Whence this bold intrusion, Sir Knight?? said De Vauxsternly, yet in a tone which respected his master?s slumbers.?Hold! De Vaux,? said Richard, awaking on the instant; 175Sir Walter Scott?Sir Kenneth cometh like a good soldier to render an ac-count of his guard. To such the general?s tent is ever acces-sible.? Then rising from his slumbering posture, and leaningon his elbow, he fixed his large bright eye upon the war-rior? ?Speak, Sir Scot; thou comest to tell me of a vigilant,safe, and honourable watch, dost thou not? The rustling ofthe folds of the Banner of England were enough to guard it,even without the body of such a knight as men hold thee.??As men will hold me no more,? said Sir Kenneth. ?Mywatch hath neither been vigilant, safe, nor honourable. TheBanner of England has been carried off.??And thou alive to tell it!? said Richard, in a tone of deri-sive incredulity. ?Away, it cannot be. There is not even ascratch on thy face. Why dost thou stand thus mute?  Speakthe truth?it is ill jesting with a king; yet I will forgive theeif thou hast lied.??Lied, Sir King!? returned the unfortunate knight, withfierce emphasis, and one glance of fire from his eye, brightand transient as the flash from the cold and stony flint. ?Butthis also must be endured. I have spoken the truth.??By God and by Saint George!? said the King, burstinginto fury, which, however, he instantly checked. ?De Vaux,go view the spot. This fever has disturbed his brain. Thiscannot be. The man?s courage is proof. It cannot be! Go speed-ily?or send, if thou wilt not go.?The King was interrupted by Sir Henry Neville, who came,breathless, to say that the banner was gone, and the knight whoguarded it overpowered, and most probably murdered, as therewas a pool of blood where the banner-spear lay shivered.?But whom do I see here?? said Neville, his eyes suddenlyresting upon Sir Kenneth.?A traitor,? said the King, starting to his feet, and seizingthe curtal-axe, which was ever near his bed??a traitor! whomthou shalt see die a traitor?s death.? And he drew back theweapon as in act to strike.Colourless, but firm as a marble statue, the Scot stood be-fore him, with his bare head uncovered by any protection,his eyes cast down to the earth, his lips scarcely moving, yetmuttering probably in prayer. Opposite to him, and withinthe due reach for a blow, stood King Richard, his large per-son wrapt in the folds of his camiscia, or ample gown oflinen, except where the violence of his action had flung the 176The Talismancovering from his right arm, shoulder, and a part of his breast,leaving to view a specimen of a frame which might havemerited his Saxon predecessor?s epithet of Ironside. He stoodfor an instant, prompt to strike; then sinking the head of theweapon towards the ground, he exclaimed, ?But there wasblood, Neville?there was blood upon the place. Hark thee,Sir Scot?brave thou wert once, for I have seen thee fight.Say thou hast slain two of the thieves in defence of the Stan-dard?say but one?say thou hast struck but a good blow inour behalf, and get thee out of the camp with thy life andthy infamy!??You have called me liar, my Lord King,? replied Kennethfirmly; ?and therein, at least, you have done me wrong. Knowthat there was no blood shed in defence of the Standard savethat of a poor hound, which, more faithful than his master,defended the charge which he deserted.??Now, by Saint George!? said Richard, again heaving uphis arm. But De Vaux threw himself between the King andthe object of his vengeance, and spoke with the blunt truthof his character, ?My liege, this must not be?here, nor byyour hand. It is enough of folly for one night and day tohave entrusted your banner to a Scot. Said I not they wereever fair and false?? [Such were the terms in which the En-glish used to speak of their poor northern neighbours, for-getting that their own encroachments upon the independenceof Scotland obliged the weaker nation to defend themselvesby policy as well as force. The disgrace must be divided be-tween Edward I. and Edward III., who enforced their domi-nation over a free country, and the Scots, who were com-pelled to take compulsory oaths, without any purpose ofkeeping them.]?Thou didst, De Vaux; thou wast right, and I confess it,?said Richard. ?I should have known him better?I shouldhave remembered how the fox William deceived me touch-ing this Crusade.??My lord,? said Sir Kenneth, ?William of Scotland neverdeceived; but circumstances prevented his bringing hisforces.??Peace, shameless!? said the King; ?thou sulliest the nameof a prince, even by speaking it.?And yet, De Vaux, it isstrange,? he added, ?to see the bearing of the man. Cowardor traitor he must be, yet he abode the blow of Richard 177Sir Walter ScottPlantagenet as our arm had been raised to lay knighthoodon his shoulder. Had he shown the slightest sign of fear, hadbut a joint trembled or an eyelid quivered, I had shatteredhis head like a crystal goblet. But I cannot strike where thereis neither fear nor resistance.?There was a pause.?My lord,? said Kenneth??Ha!? replied Richard, interrupting him, ?hast thou foundthy speech?  Ask grace from Heaven, but none from me; forEngland is dishonoured through thy fault, and wert thoumine own and only brother, there is no pardon for thy fault.??I speak not to demand grace of mortal man,? said theScot; ?it is in your Grace?s pleasure to give or refuse me timefor Christian shrift?if man denies it, may God grant methe absolution which I would otherwise ask of His church!But whether I die on the instant, or half an hour hence, Iequally beseech your Grace for one moment?s opportunityto speak that to your royal person which highly concernsyour fame as a Christian king.??Say on,? said the King, making no doubt that he was aboutto hear some confession concerning the loss of the Banner.?What I have to speak,? said Sir Kenneth, ?touches theroyalty of England, and must be said to no ears but thineown.??Begone with yourselves, sirs,? said the King to Nevilleand De Vaux.The first obeyed, but the latter would not stir from theKing?s presence.?If you said I was in the right,? replied De Vaux to hissovereign, ?I will be treated as one should be who hath beenfound to be right?that is, I will have my own will. I leaveyou not with this false Scot.??How! De Vaux,? said Richard angrily, and stamping slightly,?darest thou not venture our person with one traitor???It is in vain you frown and stamp, my lord,? said De Vaux;?I venture not a sick man with a sound one, a naked manwith one armed in proof.??It matters not,? said the Scottish knight; ?I seek no ex-cuse to put off time. I will speak in presence of the Lord ofGilsland. He is good lord and true.??But half an hour since,? said De Vaux, with a groan, im-plying a mixture of sorrow and vexation, ?and I had said as 178The Talismanmuch for thee!??There is treason around you, King of England,? contin-ued Sir Kenneth.?It may well be as thou sayest,? replied Richard; ?I have apregnant example.??Treason that will injure thee more deeply than the loss ofa hundred banners in a pitched field. The?the?? Sir Ken-neth hesitated, and at length continued, in a lower tone, ?TheLady Edith???Ha!? said the King, drawing himself suddenly into a stateof haughty attention, and fixing his eye firmly on the sup-posed criminal; ?what of her? what of her? What has she todo with this matter???My lord,? said the Scot, ?there is a scheme on foot todisgrace your royal lineage, by bestowing the hand of theLady Edith on the Saracen Soldan, and thereby to purchasea peace most dishonourable to Christendom, by an alliancemost shameful to England.?This communication had precisely the contrary effect fromthat which Sir Kenneth expected. Richard Plantagenet wasone of those who, in Iago?s words, would not serve God be-cause it was the devil who bade him; advice or informationoften affected him less according to its real import, thanthrough the tinge which it took from the supposed characterand views of those by whom it was communicated. Unfor-tunately, the mention of his relative?s name renewed his rec-ollection of what he had considered as extreme presumptionin the Knight of the Leopard, even when he stood high inthe roll of chivalry, but which, in his present condition, ap-peared an insult sufficient to drive the fiery monarch into afrenzy of passion.?Silence,? he said, ?infamous and audacious! By Heaven, Iwill have thy tongue torn out with hot pincers, for mention-ing the very name of a noble Christian damsel! Know, de-generate traitor, that I was already aware to what height thouhadst dared to raise thine eyes, and endured it, though itwere insolence, even when thou hadst cheated us?for thouart all a deceit?into holding thee as of some name and fame.But now, with lips blistered with the confession of thine owndishonour?that thou shouldst now dare to name our noblekinswoman as one in whose fate thou hast part or interest!What is it to thee if she marry Saracen or Christian? What is 179Sir Walter Scottit to thee if, in a camp where princes turn cowards by dayand robbers by night?where brave knights turn to paltrydeserters and traitors?what is it, I say, to thee, or any one, ifI should please to ally myself to truth and to valour, in theperson of Saladin???Little to me, indeed, to whom all the world will soon beas nothing,? answered Sir Kenneth boldly; ?but were I nowstretched on the rack, I would tell thee that what I have saidis much to thine own conscience and thine own fame. I tellthee, Sir King, that if thou dost but in thought entertain thepurpose of wedding thy kinswoman, the Lady Edith???Name her not?and for an instant think not of her,? saidthe King, again straining the curtal-axe in his gripe, until themuscles started above his brawny arm, like cordage formedby the ivy around the limb of an oak.?Not name?not think of her!? answered Sir Kenneth, hisspirits, stunned as they were by self-depression, beginningto recover their elasticity from this species of controversy.?Now, by the Cross, on which I place my hope, her nameshall be the last word in my mouth, her image the last thoughtin my mind. Try thy boasted strength on this bare brow, andsee if thou canst prevent my purpose.??He will drive me mad!? said Richard, who, in his despite,was once more staggered in his purpose by the dauntless de-termination of the criminal.Ere Thomas of Gilsland could reply, some bustle was heardwithout, and the arrival of the Queen was announced fromthe outer part of the pavilion.?Detain her?detain her, Neville,? cried the King; ?this isno sight for women.?Fie, that I have suffered such a paltrytraitor to chafe me thus!?Away with him, De Vaux,? he whis-pered, ?through the back entrance of our tent; coop him upclose, and answer for his safe custody with your life. And harkye?he is presently to die?let him have a ghostly father?wewould not kill soul and body. And stay?hark thee?we willnot have him dishonoured?he shall die knightlike, in his beltand spurs; for if his treachery be as black as hell, his boldnessmay match that of the devil himself.?De Vaux, right glad, if the truth may be guessed, that thescene ended without Richard?s descending to the unkinglyact of himself slaying an unresisting prisoner, made haste toremove Sir Kenneth by a private issue to a separate tent, where 180The Talismanhe was disarmed, and put in fetters for security. De Vauxlooked on with a steady and melancholy attention, while theprovost?s officers, to whom Sir Kenneth was now commit-ted, took these severe precautions.When they were ended, he said solemnly to the unhappycriminal, ?It is King Richard?s pleasure that you dieundegraded?without mutilation of your body, Or Shameto your arms?and that your head be severed from the trunkby the sword of the executioner.??It is kind,? said the knight, in a low and rather submissivetone of voice, as one who received an unexpected favour;?my family will not then hear the worst of the tale. Oh, myfather?my father!?This muttered invocation did not escape the blunt butkindly-natured Englishman, and he brushed the back of hislarge hand over his rough features ere he could proceed.?It is Richard of England?s further pleasure,? he said atlength, ?that you have speech with a holy man; and I havemet on the passage hither with a Carmelite friar, who mayfit you for your passage. He waits without, until you are in aframe of mind to receive him.??Let it be instantly,? said the knight. ?In this also Richardis kind. I cannot be more fit to see the good father at anytime than now; for life and I have taken farewell, as twotravellers who have arrived at the crossway, where their roadsseparate.??It is well,? said De Vaux slowly and solemnly; ?for it irksme somewhat to say that which sums my message. It is KingRichard?s pleasure that you prepare for instant death.??God?s pleasure and the King?s be done,? replied the knightpatiently. ?I neither contest the justice of the sentence, nordesire delay of the execution.?De Vaux began to leave the tent, but very slowly?pausedat the door, and looked back at the Scot, from whose aspectthoughts of the world seemed banished, as if he was com-posing himself into deep devotion. The feelings of the stoutEnglish baron were in general none of the most acute, andyet, on the present occasion, his sympathy overpowered himin an unusual manner. He came hastily back to the bundleof reeds on which the captive lay, took one of his fetteredhands, and said, with as much softness as his rough voicewas capable of expressing, ?Sir Kenneth, thou art yet young? 181Sir Walter Scottthou hast a father. My Ralph, whom I left training his littlegalloway nag on the banks of the Irthing, may one day attainthy years, and, but for last night, would to God I saw hisyouth bear such promise as thine! Can nothing be said ordone in thy behalf???Nothing,? was the melancholy answer. ?I have desertedmy charge?the banner entrusted to me is lost. When theheadsman and block are prepared, the head and trunk areready to part company.??Nay, then, God have mercy!? said De Vaux. ?Yet would Irather than my best horse I had taken that watch myself.There is mystery in it, young man, as a plain man may de-scry, though he cannot see through it. Cowardice? Pshaw!No coward ever fought as I have seen thee do. Treachery? Icannot think traitors die in their treason so calmly. Thouhast been trained from thy post by some deep guile?somewell-devised stratagem?the cry of some distressed maidenhas caught thine ear, or the laughful look of some merry onehas taken thine eye. Never blush for it; we have all been ledaside by such gear. Come, I pray thee, make a clean con-science of it to me, instead of the priest. Richard is mercifulwhen his mood is abated. Hast thou nothing to entrust tome??The unfortunate knight turned his face from the kind war-rior, and answered, ?Nothing.?And De Vaux, who had exhausted his topics of persuasion,arose and left the tent, with folded arms, and in melancholydeeper than he thought the occasion merited?even angrywith himself to find that so simple a matter as the death of aScottish man could affect him so nearly.?Yet,? as he said to himself, ?though the rough-footedknaves be our enemies in Cumberland, in Palestine one al-most considers them as brethren.? 182The TalismanCHAPTER XVI.Tis not her sense, for sure in thatThere?s nothing more than common;And all her wit is only chat,Like any other woman.Song.THE HIGH-BORN BERENGARIA, daughter of Sanchez, King ofNavarre, and the Queen-Consort of the heroic Richard, wasaccounted one of the most beautiful women of the period.Her form was slight, though exquisitely moulded. She wasgraced with a complexion not common in her country, aprofusion of fair hair, and features so extremely juvenile as tomake her look several years younger than she really was,though in reality she was not above one-and-twenty. Per-haps it was under the consciousness of this extremely juve-nile appearance that she affected, or at least practised, a littlechildish petulance and wilfulness of manner, not unbefitting,she might suppose, a youthful bride, whose rank and agegave her a right to have her fantasies indulged and attendedto. She was by nature perfectly good-humoured, and if herdue share of admiration and homage (in her opinion a verylarge one) was duly resigned to her, no one could possessbetter temper or a more friendly disposition; but then, likeall despots, the more power that was voluntarily yielded toher, the more she desired to extend her sway. Sometimes,even when all her ambition was gratified, she chose to be alittle out of health, and a little out of spirits; and physicianshad to toil their wits to invent names for imaginary mala-dies, while her ladies racked their imagination for new games,new head-gear, and new court-scandal, to pass away thoseunpleasant hours, during which their own situation was scarceto be greatly envied. Their most frequent resource for divert-ing this malady was some trick or piece of mischief practisedupon each other; and the good Queen, in the buoyancy ofher reviving spirits, was, to speak truth, rather too indiffer-ent whether the frolics thus practised were entirely befittingher own dignity, or whether the pain which those sufferedupon whom they were inflicted was not beyond the propor-tion of pleasure which she herself derived from them. She 183Sir Walter Scottwas confident in her husband?s favour, in her high rank, andin her supposed power to make good whatever such pranksmight cost others. In a word, she gambolled with the free-dom of a young lioness, who is unconscious of the weight ofher own paws when laid on those whom she sports with.The Queen Berengaria loved her husband passionately, butshe feared the loftiness and roughness of his character; andas she felt herself not to be his match in intellect, was notmuch pleased to see that he would often talk with EdithPlantagenet in preference to herself, simply because he foundmore amusement in her conversation, a more comprehen-sive understanding, and a more noble cast of thoughts andsentiments, than his beautiful consort exhibited. Berengariadid not hate Edith on this account, far less meditate her anyharm; for, allowing for some selfishness, her character was,on the whole, innocent and generous. But the ladies of hertrain, sharpsighted in such matters, had for some time dis-covered that a poignant jest at the expense of the Lady Edithwas a specific for relieving her Grace of England?s low spirits,and the discovery saved their imagination much toil.There was something ungenerous in this, because the LadyEdith was understood to be an orphan; and though she wascalled Plantagenet, and the fair Maid of Anjou, and admit-ted by Richard to certain privileges only granted to the royalfamily, and held her place in the circle accordingly, yet fewknew, and none acquainted with the Court of England ven-tured to ask, in what exact degree of relationship she stoodto Coeur de Lion. She had come with Eleanor, the celebratedQueen Mother of England, and joined Richard at Messina,as one of the ladies destined to attend on Berengaria, whosenuptials then approached. Richard treated his kinswomanwith much respectful observance, and the Queen made herher most constant attendant, and, even in despite of the pettyjealousy which we have observed, treated her, generally, withsuitable respect.The ladies of the household had, for a long time, no fur-ther advantage over Edith than might be afforded by an op-portunity of censuring a less artfully disposed head attire oran unbecoming robe; for the lady was judged to be inferiorin these mysteries. The silent devotion of the Scottish knightdid not, indeed, pass unnoticed; his liveries, his cognizances,his feats of arms, his mottoes and devices, were nearly 184The Talismanwatched, and occasionally made the subject of a passing jest.But then came the pilgrimage of the Queen and her ladies toEngaddi, a journey which the Queen had undertaken undera vow for the recovery of her husband?s health, and whichshe had been encouraged to carry into effect by the Arch-bishop of Tyre for a political purpose. It was then, and in thechapel at that holy place, connected from above with aCarmelite nunnery, from beneath with the cell of the ancho-rite, that one of the Queen?s attendants remarked that secretsign of intelligence which Edith had made to her lover, andfailed not instantly to communicate it to her Majesty. TheQueen returned from her pilgrimage enriched with this ad-mirable recipe against dullness or ennui; and her train was atthe same time augmented by a present of two wretched dwarfsfrom the dethroned Queen of Jerusalem, as deformed and ascrazy (the excellence of that unhappy species) as any Queencould have desired. One of Berengaria?s idle amusements hadbeen to try the effect of the sudden appearance of such ghastlyand fantastic forms on the nerves of the Knight when leftalone in the chapel; but the jest had been lost by the compo-sure of the Scot and the interference of the anchorite. Shehad now tried another, of which the consequences promisedto be more serious.The ladies again met after Sir Kenneth had retired fromthe tent, and the Queen, at first little moved by Edith?s an-gry expostulations, only replied to her by upbraiding herprudery, and by indulging her wit at the expense of the garb,nation, and, above all the poverty of the Knight of the Leop-ard, in which she displayed a good deal of playful malice,mingled with some humour, until Edith was compelled tocarry her anxiety to her separate apartment. But when, inthe morning, a female whom Edith had entrusted to makeinquiry brought word that the Standard was missing, and itschampion vanished, she burst into the Queen?s apartment,and implored her to rise and proceed to the King?s tent with-out delay, and use her powerful mediation to prevent theevil consequences of her jest.The Queen, frightened in her turn, cast, as is usual, theblame of her own folly on those around her, and endeav-oured to comfort Edith?s grief, and appease her displeasure,by a thousand inconsistent arguments. She was sure no harmhad chanced?the knight was sleeping, she fancied, after his 185Sir Walter Scottnight-watch. What though, for fear of the King?s displea-sure, he had deserted with the Standard?it was but a pieceof silk, and he but a needy adventurer; or if he was put underwarding for a time, she would soon get the King to pardonhim?it was but waiting to let Richard?s mood pass away.Thus she continued talking thick and fast, and heapingtogether all sorts of inconsistencies, with the vain expecta-tion of persuading both Edith and herself that no harm couldcome of a frolic which in her heart she now bitterly repented.But while Edith in vain strove to intercept this torrent ofidle talk, she caught the eye of one of the ladies who enteredthe Queen?s apartment. There was death in her look of af-fright and horror, and Edith, at the first glance of her coun-tenance, had sunk at once on the earth, had not strong ne-cessity and her own elevation of character enabled her tomaintain at least external composure.?Madam,? she said to the Queen, ?lose not another wordin speaking, but save life?if, indeed,? she added, her voicechoking as she said it, ?life may yet be saved.??It may, it may,? answered the Lady Calista. ?I have justheard that he has been brought before the King. It is not yetover ?but,? she added, bursting into a vehement flood ofweeping, in which personal apprehensions had some share,?it will soon, unless some course be taken.??I will vow a golden candlestick to the Holy Sepulchre, ashrine of silver to our Lady of Engaddi, a pall, worth onehundred byzants, to Saint Thomas of Orthez,? said the Queenin extremity.?Up, up, madam!? said Edith; ?call on the saints if you list,but be your own best saint.??Indeed, madam,? said the terrified attendant, ?the LadyEdith speaks truth. Up, madam, and let us to King Richard?stent and beg the poor gentleman?s life.??I will go?I will go instantly,? said the Queen, rising andtrembling excessively; while her women, in as great confusionas herself, were unable to render her those duties which wereindispensable to her levee. Calm, composed, only pale as death,Edith ministered to the Queen with her own hand, and alonesupplied the deficiencies of her numerous attendants.?How you wait, wenches!? said the Queen, not able eventhen to forget frivolous distinctions. ?Suffer ye the Lady Edithto do the duties of your attendance? Seest thou, Edith, they 186The Talismancan do nothing; I shall never be attired in time. We will sendfor the Archbishop of Tyre, and employ him as a mediator.??Oh, no, no!? exclaimed Edith. ?Go yourself madam; youhave done the evil, do you confer the remedy.??I will go?I will go,? said the Queen; ?but if Richard bein his mood, I dare not speak to him?he will kill me!??Yet go, gracious madam,? said the Lady Calista, who bestknew her mistress?s temper; ?not a lion, in his fury, couldlook upon such a face and form, and retain so much as anangry thought, far less a love-true knight like the royal Rich-ard, to whom your slightest word would be a command.??Dost thou think so, Calista?? said the Queen. ?Ah, thoulittle knowest yet I will go. But see you here, what meansthis?  You have bedizened me in green, a colour he detests.Lo you! let me have a blue robe, and?search for the rubycarcanet, which was part of the King of Cyprus?s ransom; itis either in the steel casket, or somewhere else.??This, and a man?s life at stake!? said Edith indignantly; ?itpasses human patience. Remain at your ease, madam; I willgo to King Richard. I am a party interested. I will know ifthe honour of a poor maiden of his blood is to be so fartampered with that her name shall be abused to train a bravegentleman from his duty, bring him within the compass ofdeath and infamy, and make, at the same time, the glory ofEngland a laughing-stock to the whole Christian army.?At this unexpected burst of passion, Berengaria listenedwith an almost stupefied look of fear and wonder. But asEdith was about to leave the tent, she exclaimed, thoughfaintly, ?Stop her, stop her!??You must indeed stop, noble Lady Edith,? said Calista,taking her arm gently; ?and you, royal madam, I am sure,will go, and without further dallying. If the Lady Edith goesalone to the King, he will be dreadfully incensed, nor will itbe one life that will stay his fury.??I will go?I will go,? said the Queen, yielding to neces-sity; and Edith reluctantly halted to wait her movements.They were now as speedy as she could have desired. TheQueen hastily wrapped herself in a large loose mantle, whichcovered all inaccuracies of the toilet. In this guise, attendedby Edith and her women, and preceded and followed by afew officers and men-at-arms, she hastened to the tent of herlionlike husband. 187Sir Walter ScottCHAPTER XVII.Were every hair upon his head a life,And every life were to be supplicatedBy numbers equal to those hairs quadrupled,Life after life should out like waning starsBefore the daybreak?or as festive lamps,Which have lent lustre to the midnight revel,Each after each are quench?d when guests depart!Old PlayTHE ENTRANCE of Queen Berengaria into the interior ofRichard?s pavilion was withstood?in the most respectful andreverential manner indeed, but still withstood?by the cham-berlains who watched in the outer tent. She could hear thestern command of the King from within, prohibiting theirentrance.?You see,? said the Queen, appealing to Edith, as if shehad exhausted all means of intercession in her power; ?I knewit?the King will not receive us.?At the same time, they heard Richard speak to some onewithin: ??Go, speed thine office quickly, sirrah, for in thatconsists thy mercy?ten byzants if thou dealest on him atone blow. And hark thee, villain, observe if his cheek losescolour, or his eye falters; mark me the smallest twitch of thefeatures, or wink of the eyelid. I love to know how bravesouls meet death.??If he sees my blade waved aloft without shrinking, he isthe first ever did so,? answered a harsh, deep voice, which asense of unusual awe had softened into a sound much lowerthan its usual coarse tones.Edith could remain silent no longer. ?If your Grace,? shesaid to the Queen, ?make not your own way, I make it foryou; or if not for your Majesty, for myself at least.?Cham-berlain, the Queen demands to see King Richard?the wifeto speak with her husband.??Noble lady,? said the officer, lowering his wand of office,?it grieves me to gainsay you, but his Majesty is busied onmatters of life and death.??And we seek also to speak; with him on matters of lifeand death,? said Edith. ?I will make entrance for your Grace.? 188The TalismanAnd putting aside the chamberlain with one hand, she laidhold on the curtain with the other.?I dare not gainsay her Majesty?s pleasure,? said the cham-berlain, yielding to the vehemence of the fair petitioner; andas he gave way, the Queen found herself obliged to enter theapartment of Richard.The Monarch was lying on his couch, and at some dis-tance, as awaiting his further commands, stood a man whoseprofession it was not difficult to conjecture. He was clothedin a jerkin of red cloth, which reached scantly below theshoulders, leaving the arms bare from about half way abovethe elbow; and as an upper garment, he wore, when about asat present to betake himself to his dreadful office, a coat ortabard without sleeves, something like that of a herald, madeof dressed bull?s hide, and stained in the front with many abroad spot and speckle of dull crimson. The jerkin, and thetabard over it, reached the knee; and the nether stocks, orcovering of the legs, were of the same leather which com-posed the tabard. A cap of rough shag served to hide theupper part of a visage which, like that of a screech owl, seemeddesirous to conceal itself from light, the lower part of theface being obscured by a huge red beard, mingling with shaggylocks of the same colour. What features were seen were sternand misanthropical. The man?s figure was short, strongly made,with a neck like a bull, very broad shoulders, arms of great anddisproportioned length, a huge square trunk, and thick bandylegs. This truculent official leant on a sword, the blade of whichwas nearly four feet and a half in length, while the handle oftwenty inches, surrounded by a ring of lead plummets to coun-terpoise the weight of such a blade, rose considerably abovethe man?s head as he rested his arm upon its hilt, waiting forKing Richard?s further directions.On the sudden entrance of the ladies, Richard, who wasthen lying on his couch with his face towards the entrance,and resting on his elbow as he spoke to his grisly attendant,flung himself hastily, as if displeased and surprised, to theother side, turning his back to the Queen and the females ofher train, and drawing around him the covering of his couch,which, by his own choice, or more probably the flatteringselection of his chamberlains, consisted of two large lions?skins, dressed in Venice with such admirable skill that theyseemed softer than the hide of the deer. 189Sir Walter ScottBerengaria, such as we have described her, knew well?what woman knows not??her own road to victory. After ahurried glance of undisguised and unaffected terror at theghastly companion of her husband?s secret counsels, sherushed at once to the side of Richard?s couch, dropped onher knees, flung her mantle from her shoulders, showing, asthey hung down at their full length, her beautiful goldentresses, and while her countenance seemed like the sun burst-ing through a cloud, yet bearing on its pallid front tracesthat its splendours have been obscured, she seized upon theright hand of the King, which, as he assumed his wontedposture, had been employed in dragging the covering of hiscouch, and gradually pulling it to her with a force which wasresisted, though but faintly, she possessed herself of that arm,the prop of Christendom and the dread of Heathenesse, andimprisoning its strength in both her little fairy hands, shebent upon it her brow, and united to it her lips.?What needs this, Berengaria?? said Richard, his head stillaverted, but his hand remaining under her control.?Send away that man, his look kills me!? mutteredBerengaria.?Begone, sirrah,? said Richard, still without looking round,?What wait?st thou for? art thou fit to look on these ladies???Your Highness?s pleasure touching the head,? said the man.?Out with thee, dog!? answered Richard??a Christianburial!? The man disappeared, after casting a look upon thebeautiful Queen, in her deranged dress and natural loveliness,with a smile of admiration more hideous in its expression thaneven his usual scowl of cynical hatred against humanity.?And now, foolish wench, what wishest thou?? said Rich-ard, turning slowly and half reluctantly round to his royalsuppliant.But it was not in nature for any one, far less an admirer ofbeauty like Richard, to whom it stood only in the secondrank to glory, to look without emotion on the countenanceand the tremor of a creature so beautiful as Berengaria, or tofeel, without sympathy, that her lips, her brow, were on hishand, and that it was wetted by her tears. By degrees, heturned on her his manly countenance, with the softest ex-pression of which his large blue eye, which so often gleamedwith insufferable light, was capable. Caressing her fair head,and mingling his large fingers in her beautiful and dishev- 190The Talismanelled locks, he raised and tenderly kissed the cherub counte-nance which seemed desirous to hide itself in his hand. Therobust form, the broad, noble brow and majestic looks, thenaked arm and shoulder, the lions? skins among which helay, and the fair, fragile feminine creature that kneeled by hisside, might have served for a model of Hercules reconcilinghimself, after a quarrel, to his wife Dejanira.?And, once more, what seeks the lady of my heart in herknight?s pavilion at this early and unwonted hour???Pardon, my most gracious liege?pardon!? said the Queen,whose fears began again to unfit her for the duty of intercessor.?Pardon?for what?? asked the King.?First, for entering your royal presence too boldly andunadvisedly??She stopped.Thou too boldly!?the sun might as well ask pardon be-cause his rays entered the windows of some wretch?s dun-geon. But I was busied with work unfit for thee to witness,my gentle one; and I was unwilling, besides, that thoushouldst risk thy precious health where sickness had been solately rife.??But thou art now well?? said the Queen, still delaying thecommunication which she feared to make.?Well enough to break a lance on the bold crest of thatchampion who shall refuse to acknowledge thee the fairestdame in Christendom.??Thou wilt not then refuse me one boon?only one?only a poor life???Ha!?proceed,? said King Richard, bending his brows.?This unhappy Scottish knight?? murmured the Queen.?Speak not of him, madam,? exclaimed Richard sternly;?he dies?his doom is fixed.??Nay, my royal liege and love, ?tis but a silken banner ne-glected. Berengaria will give thee another broidered with herown hand, and rich as ever dallied with the wind. Every pearlhave shall go to bedeck it, and with every pearl I will drop atear of thankfulness to my generous knight.??Thou knowest not what thou sayest,? said the King, in-terrupting her in anger. ?Pearls! can all the pearls of the Eastatone for a speck upon England?s honour?all the tears thatever woman?s eye wept wash away a stain on Richard?s fame?Go to, madam, know your place, and your time, and your 191Sir Walter Scottsphere. At present we have duties in which you cannot beour partner.??Thou hearest, Edith,? whispered the Queen; ?we shallbut incense him.??Be it so,? said Edith, stepping forward.??My lord, I, yourpoor kinswoman, crave you for justice rather than mercy;and to the cry of justice the ears of a monarch should beopen at every time, place, and circumstance.??Ha! our cousin Edith?? said Richard, rising and sittingupright on the side of his couch, covered with his longcamiscia. ?She speaks ever kinglike, and kinglike will I an-swer her, so she bring no request unworthy herself or me.?The beauty of Edith was of a more intellectual and lessvoluptuous cast than that of the Queen; but impatience andanxiety had given her countenance a glow which it some-times wanted, and her mien had a character of energetic dig-nity that imposed silence for a moment even on Richardhimself, who, to judge by his looks, would willingly haveinterrupted her.?My lord,? she said, ?this good knight, whose blood youare about to spill, hath done, in his time, service toChristendom. He has fallen from his duty through a snareset for him in mere folly and idleness of spirit. A messagesent to him in the name of one who?why should I notspeak it??it was in my own?induced him for an instant toleave his post. And what knight in the Christian camp mightnot have thus far transgressed at command of a maiden, who,poor howsoever in other qualities, hath yet the blood ofPlantagenet in her veins???And you saw him, then, cousin?? replied the King, bitinghis lips to keep down his passion.?I did, my liege,? said Edith. ?It is no time to explain where-fore. I am here neither to exculpate myself nor to blame others.??And where did you do him such a grace???In the tent of her Majesty the Queen.??Of our royal consort!? said Richard. ?Now by Heaven, bySaint George of England, and every other saint that treadsits crystal floor, this is too audacious! I have noticed andoverlooked this warrior?s insolent admiration of one so farabove him, and I grudged him not that one of my bloodshould shed from her high-born sphere such influence as thesun bestows on the world beneath. But, heaven and earth! 192The Talismanthat you should have admitted him to an audience by night,in the very tent of our royal consort!?and dare to offer thisas an excuse for his disobedience and desertion! By my father?ssoul, Edith, thou shalt rue this thy life long in a monastery!??My liege,? said Edith, ?your greatness licenses tyranny.My honour, Lord King, is as little touched as yours, and myLady the Queen can prove it if she think fit. But I have al-ready said I am not here to excuse myself or inculpate oth-ers. I ask you but to extend to one, whose fault was commit-ted under strong temptation, that mercy, which even youyourself, Lord King, must one day supplicate at a higher tri-bunal, and for faults, perhaps, less venial.??Can this be Edith Plantagenet?? said the King bitterly??Edith Plantagenet, the wise and the noble? Or is it somelovesick woman who cares not for her own fame in compari-son of the life of her paramour? Now, by King Henry?s soul!little hinders but I order thy minion?s skull to be broughtfrom the gibbet, and fixed as a perpetual ornament by thecrucifix in thy cell!??And if thou dost send it from the gibbet to be placed forever in my sight,? said Edith, ?I will say it is a relic of a goodknight, cruelly and unworthily done to death by? (shechecked herself)??by one of whom I shall only say, he shouldhave known better how to reward chivalry. Minion callestthou him?? she continued, with increasing vehemence. ?Hewas indeed my lover, and a most true one; but never soughthe grace from me by look or word?contented with suchhumble observance as men pay to the saints. And the good?the valiant?the faithful must die for this!??Oh, peace, peace, for pity?s sake,? whispered the Queen,?you do but offend him more!??I care not,? said Edith; ?the spotless virgin fears not theraging lion. Let him work his will on this worthy knight.Edith, for whom he dies, will know how to weep his memory.To me no one shall speak more of politic alliances to be sanc-tioned with this poor hand. I could not?I would not ?have been his bride living?our degrees were too distant.But death unites the high and the low?I am henceforwardthe spouse of the grave.?The King was about to answer with much anger, when aCarmelite monk entered the apartment hastily, his head andperson muffled in the long mantle and hood of striped cloth 193Sir Walter Scottof the coarsest texture which distinguished his order, and,flinging himself on his knees before the King, conjured him,by every holy word and sign, to stop the execution.?Now, by both sword and sceptre,? said Richard, ?the worldis leagued to drive me mad!?fools, women, and monks crossme at every step. How comes he to live still???My gracious liege,? said the monk, ?I entreated of theLord of Gilsland to stay the execution until I had thrownmyself at your royal???And he was wilful enough to grant thy request,? said theKing;? but it is of a piece with his wonted obstinacy. Andwhat is it thou hast to say? Speak, in the fiend?s name!??My lord, there is a weighty secret, but it rests under theseal of confession. I dare not tell or even whisper it; but Iswear to thee by my holy order, by the habit which I wear,by the blessed Elias, our founder, even him who was trans-lated without suffering the ordinary pangs of mortality, thatthis youth hath divulged to me a secret, which, if I mightconfide it to thee, would utterly turn thee from thy bloodypurpose in regard to him.??Good father,? said Richard, ?that I reverence the church,let the arms which I now wear for her sake bear witness.Give me to know this secret, and I will do what shall seemfitting in the matter. But I am no blind Bayard, to take a leapin the dark under the stroke of a pair of priestly spurs.??My lord,? said the holy man, throwing back his cowl andupper vesture, and discovering under the latter a garment ofgoatskin, and from beneath the former a visage so wildlywasted by climate, fast, and penance, as to resemble ratherthe apparition of an animated skeleton than a human face,?for twenty years have I macerated this miserable body inthe caverns of Engaddi, doing penance for a great crime.Think you I, who am dead to the world, would contrive afalsehood to endanger my own soul; or that one, bound bythe most sacred oaths to the contrary?one such as I, whohave but one longing wish connected with earth, to wit, therebuilding of our Christian Zion?would betray the secretsof the confessional? Both are alike abhorrent to my very soul.??So,? answered the King, ?thou art that hermit of whommen speak so much? Thou art, I confess, like enough to thosespirits which walk in dry places; but Richard fears no hob-goblins. And thou art he, too, as I bethink me, to whom the 194The TalismanChristian princes sent this very criminal to open a commu-nication with the Soldan, even while I, who ought to havebeen first consulted, lay on my sick-bed? Thou and they maycontent themselves?I will not put my neck into the loop ofa Carmelite?s girdle. And, for your envoy, he shall die therather and the sooner that thou dost entreat for him.??Now God be gracious to thee, Lord King!? said the her-mit, with much emotion; ?thou art setting that mischief onfoot which thou wilt hereafter wish thou hadst stopped,though it had cost thee a limb. Rash, blinded man, yet for-bear!??Away, away,? cried the King, stamping; ?the sun has risenon the dishonour of England, and it is not yet avenged.?Ladies and priest, withdraw, if you would not hear orderswhich would displease you; for, by St. George, I swear???Swear not!? said the voice of one who had just then en-tered the pavilion.?Ha! my learned Hakim,? said the King, ?come, I hope, totax our generosity.??I come to request instant speech with you?instant?andtouching matters of deep interest.??First look on my wife, Hakim, and let her know in youthe preserver of her husband.??It is not for me,? said the physician, folding his arms withan air of Oriental modesty and reverence, and bending hiseyes on the ground??it is not for me to look upon beautyunveiled, and armed in its splendours.??Retire, then, Berengaria,? said the Monarch; ?and, Edith,do you retire also;?nay, renew not your importunities! ThisI give to them that the execution shall not be till high noon.Go and be pacified?dearest Berengaria, begone.?Edith,?he added, with a glance which struck terror even into thecourageous soul of his kinswoman, ?go, if you are wise.?The females withdrew, or rather hurried from the tent,rank and ceremony forgotten, much like a flock of wild-fowlhuddled together, against whom the falcon has made a re-cent stoop.They returned from thence to the Queen?s pavilion to in-dulge in regrets and recriminations, equally unavailing. Edithwas the only one who seemed to disdain these ordinary chan-nels of sorrow. Without a sigh, without a tear, without aword of upbraiding, she attended upon the Queen, whose 195Sir Walter Scottweak temperament showed her sorrow in violent hystericalecstasies and passionate hypochondriacal effusions, in thecourse of which Edith sedulously and even affectionately at-tended her.?It is impossible she can have loved this knight,? said Floriseto Calista, her senior in attendance upon the Queen?s per-son. ?We have been mistaken; she is but sorry for his fate, asfor a stranger who has come to trouble on her account.??Hush, hush,? answered her more experienced and moreobservant comrade; ?she is of that proud house of Plantagenetwho never own that a hurt grieves them. While they havethemselves been bleeding to death, under a mortal wound,they have been known to bind up the scratches sustained bytheir more faint-hearted comrades. Florise, we have donefrightfully wrong, and, for my own part, I would buy withevery jewel I have that our fatal jest had remained unacted.?CHAPTER XVIII.This work desires a planetary intelligenceOf Jupiter and Sol; and those great spiritsAre proud, fantastical. It asks great chargesTo entice them from the guiding of their spheres,To wait on mortals.Albumazar.THE HERMIT followed the ladies from the pavilion of Rich-ard, as shadow follows a beam of sunshine when the cloudsare driving over the face of the sun. But he turned on thethreshold, and held up his hand towards the King in a warn-ing, or almost a menacing posture, as he said, ?Woe to himwho rejects the counsel of the church, and betaketh himselfto the foul divan of the infidel! King Richard, I do not yetshake the dust from my feet and depart from thy encamp-ment; the sword falls not?but it hangs but by a hair. Haughtymonarch, we shall meet again.??Be it so, haughty priest,? returned Richard, ?prouder in 196The Talismanthy goatskins than princes in purple and fine linen.?The hermit vanished from the tent, and the King contin-ued, addressing the Arabian, ?Do the dervises of the East,wise Hakim, use such familiarity with their princes???The dervise,? replied Adonbec, ?should be either a sageor a madman; there is no middle course for him who wearsthe khirkhah, [Literally, the torn robe. The habit of thedervises is so called.] who watches by night, and fasts by day.Hence hath he either wisdom enough to bear himself dis-creetly in the presence of princes; or else, having no reasonbestowed on him, he is not responsible for his own actions.??Methinks our monks have adopted chiefly the latter char-acter,? said Richard. ?But to the matter. In what can I plea-sure you, my learned physician???Great King,? said El Hakim, making his profound Ori-ental obeisance, ?let thy servant speak one word, and yetlive. I would remind thee that thou owest?not to me, theirhumble instrument?but to the Intelligences, whose ben-efits I dispense to mortals, a life???And I warrant me thou wouldst have another in requital,ha?? interrupted the King.?Such is my humble prayer,? said the Hakim, ?to the greatMelech Ric?even the life of this good knight, who is doomedto die, and but for such fault as was committed by the SultanAdam, surnamed Aboulbeschar, or the father of all men.??And thy wisdom might remind thee, Hakim, that Adamdied for it,? said the King, somewhat sternly, and then be-gan to pace the narrow space of his tent with some emotion,and to talk to himself. ?Why, God-a-mercy, I knew what hedesired as soon as ever he entered the pavilion! Here is onepoor life justly condemned to extinction, and I, a king and asoldier, who have slain thousands by my command, and scoreswith my own hand, am to have no power over it, althoughthe honour of my arms, of my house, of my very Queen,hath been attainted by the culprit. By Saint George, it makesme laugh! By Saint Louis, it reminds me of Blondel?s tale ofan enchanted castle, where the destined knight was with-stood successively in his purpose of entrance by forms andfigures the most dissimilar, but all hostile to his undertaking!No sooner one sunk than another appeared! Wife?kins-woman?hermit?Hakim-each appears in the lists as soonas the other is defeated! Why, this is a single knight fighting 197Sir Walter Scottagainst the whole melee of the tournament?ha! ha! ha!? AndRichard laughed aloud; for he had, in fact, begun to changehis mood, his resentment being usually too violent to be oflong endurance.The physician meanwhile looked on him with a counte-nance of surprise, not unmingled with contempt; for theEastern people make no allowance for these mercurial changesin the temper, and consider open laughter, upon almost anyaccount, as derogatory to the dignity of man, and becomingonly to women and children. At length the sage addressedthe King when he saw him more composed:??A doom of death should not issue from laughing lips. Letthy servant hope that thou hast granted him this man?s life.??Take the freedom of a thousand captives instead,? saidRichard; ?restore so many of thy countrymen to their tentsand families, and I will give the warrant instantly. This man?slife can avail thee nothing, and it is forfeited.??All our lives are forfeited,? said the Hakim, putting hishand to his cap. ?But the great Creditor is merciful, andexacts not the pledge rigorously nor untimely.??Thou canst show me,? said Richard, ?no special interestthou hast to become intercessor betwixt me and the execu-tion of justice, to which I am sworn as a crowned king.??Thou art sworn to the dealing forth mercy as well as jus-tice,? said El Hakim; ?but what thou seekest, great King, isthe execution of thine own will. And for the concern I havein this request, know that many a man?s life depends uponthy granting this boon.??Explain thy words,? said Richard; ?but think not to im-pose upon me by false pretexts.??Be it far from thy servant!? said Adonbec. ?Know, then,that the medicine to which thou, Sir King, and many onebesides, owe their recovery, is a talisman, composed undercertain aspects of the heavens, when the Divine Intelligencesare most propitious. I am but the poor administrator of itsvirtues. I dip it in a cup of water, observe the fitting hour toadminister it to the patient, and the potency of the draughtworks the cure.??A most rare medicine,? said the King, ?and a commodi-ous! and, as it may be carried in the leech?s purse, would savethe whole caravan of camels which they require to conveydrugs and physic stuff; I marvel there is any other in use.? 198The Talisman?It is written,? answered the Hakim, with imperturbablegravity, ??Abuse not the steed which hath borne thee fromthe battle.? Know that such talismans might indeed be framed,but rare has been the number of adepts who have dared toundertake the application of their virtue. Severe restrictions,painful observances, fasts, and penance, are necessary on thepart of the sage who uses this mode of cure; and if, throughneglect of these preparations, by his love of ease, or his in-dulgence of sensual appetite, he omits to cure at least twelvepersons within the course of each moon, the virtue of thedivine gift departs from the amulet, and both the last patientand the physician will be exposed to speedy misfortune, nei-ther will they survive the year. I require yet one life to makeup the appointed number.??Go out into the camp, good Hakim, where thou wilt finda-many,? said the King, ?and do not seek to rob my headsmanof his patients; it is unbecoming a mediciner of thine emi-nence to interfere with the practice of another. Besides, Icannot see how delivering a criminal from the death he de-serves should go to make up thy tale of miraculous cures.??When thou canst show why a draught of cold water shouldhave cured thee when the most precious drugs failed,? saidthe Hakim, ?thou mayest reason on the other mysteries at-tendant on this matter. For myself, I am inefficient to thegreat work, having this morning touched an unclean ani-mal. Ask, therefore, no further questions; it is enough that,by sparing this man?s life at my request, you will deliver your-self, great King, and thy servant, from a great danger.??Hark thee, Adonbec,? replied the King, ?I have no objec-tion that leeches should wrap their words in mist, and pre-tend to derive knowledge from the stars; but when you bidRichard Plantagenet fear that a danger will fall upon himfrom some idle omen, or omitted ceremonial, you speak tono ignorant Saxon, or doting old woman, who foregoes herpurpose because a hare crosses the path, a raven croaks, or acat sneezes.??I cannot hinder your doubt of my words,? said Adonbec;?but yet let my Lord the King grant that truth is on thetongue of his servant?will he think it just to deprive theworld, and every wretch who may suffer by the pains whichso lately reduced him to that couch, of the benefit of thismost virtuous talisman, rather than extend his forgiveness to 199Sir Walter Scottone poor criminal? Bethink you, Lord King, that, thoughthou canst slay thousands, thou canst not restore one man tohealth. Kings have the power of Satan to torment, sages thatof Allah to heal?beware how thou hinderest the good tohumanity which thou canst not thyself render. Thou canstcut off the head, but not cure the aching tooth.??This is over-insolent,? said the King, hardening himself,as the Hakim assumed a more lofty and almost a command-ing tone. ?We took thee for our leech, not for our counselloror conscience-keeper.??And is it thus the most renowned Prince of Frangistanrepays benefit done to his royal person?? said El Hakim, ex-changing the humble and stooping posture in which he hadhitherto solicited the King, for an attitude lofty and com-manding. ?Know, then,? he said, ?that: through every courtof Europe and Asia?to Moslem and Nazarene?to knightand lady?wherever harp is heard and sword worn ?wher-ever honour is loved and infamy detested?to every quarterof the world?will I denounce thee, Melech Ric, as thank-less and ungenerous; and even the lands?if there be anysuch?that never heard of thy renown shall yet be acquaintedwith thy shame!??Are these terms to me, vile infidel??  said Richard, strid-ing up to him in fury. ?Art weary of thy life???Strike!? said El Hakim; ?thine own deed shall then paintthee more worthless than could my words, though each hada hornet?s sting.?Richard turned fiercely from him, folded his arms, tra-versed the tent as before, and then exclaimed, ?Thanklessand ungenerous!?as well be termed coward and infidel!Hakim, thou hast chosen thy boon; and though I had ratherthou hadst asked my crown jewels, yet I may not, kinglike,refuse thee. Take this Scot, therefore, to thy keeping; theprovost will deliver him to thee on this warrant.?He hastily traced one or two lines, and gave them to thephysician. ?Use him as thy bond-slave, to be disposed of asthou wilt?only, let him beware how he comes before theeyes of Richard. Hark thee?thou art wise?he hath beenover-bold among those in whose fair looks and weak judg-ments we trust our honour, as you of the East lodge yourtreasures in caskets of silver wire, as fine and as frail as theweb of a gossamer.? 200The Talisman?Thy servant understands the words of the King,? said thesage, at once resuming the reverent style of address in whichhe had commenced. ?When the rich carpet is soiled, thefool pointeth to the stain?the wise man covers it with hismantle. I have heard my lord?s pleasure, and to hear is toobey.??It is well,? said the King; ?let him consult his own safety,and never appear in my presence more. Is there aught else inwhich I may do thee pleasure???The bounty of the King hath filled my cup to the brim,?said the sage?? yea, it hath been abundant as the fountainwhich sprung up amid the camp of the descendants of Israelwhen the rock was stricken by the rod of Moussa Ben Amram.??Ay, but,? said the King, smiling, ?it required, as in thedesert, a hard blow on the rock ere it yielded its treasures. Iwould that I knew something to pleasure thee, which I mightyield as freely as the natural fountain sends forth its waters.??Let me touch that victorious hand,? said the sage, ?intoken that if Adonbec el Hakim should hereafter demand aboon of Richard of England, he may do so, yet plead hiscommand.??Thou hast hand and glove upon it, man.? replied Rich-ard; ?only, if thou couldst consistently make up thy tale ofpatients without craving me to deliver from punishment thosewho have deserved it, I would more willingly discharge mydebt in some other form.??May thy days be multiplied!? answered the Hakim, andwithdrew from the apartment after the usual deep obeisance.King Richard gazed after him as he departed, like one buthalf-satisfied with what had passed.?Strange pertinacity,? he said, ?in this Hakim, and a won-derful chance to interfere between that audacious Scot andthe chastisement he has merited so richly. Yet let him live!there is one brave man the more in the world. And now forthe Austrian. Ho! is the Baron of Gilsland there without??Sir Thomas de Vaux thus summoned, his bulky form speed-ily darkened the opening of the pavilion, while behind himglided as a spectre, unannounced, yet unopposed, the savageform of the hermit of Engaddi, wrapped in his goatskin mantle.Richard, without noticing his presence, called in a loudtone to the baron, ?Sir Thomas de Vaux, of Lanercost andGilsland, take trumpet and herald, and go instantly to the 201Sir Walter Scotttent of him whom they call Archduke of Austria, and seethat it be when the press of his knights and vassals is greatestaround him, as is likely at this hour, for the German boarbreakfasts ere he hears mass?enter his presence with as littlereverence as thou mayest, and impeach him, on the part ofRichard of England, that he hath this night, by his own hand,or that of others, stolen from its staff the Banner of England.Wherefore say to him our pleasure that within an hour fromthe time of my speaking he restore the said banner with allreverence?he himself and his principal barons waiting thewhilst with heads uncovered, and without their robes ofhonour. And that, moreover, he pitch beside it, on the onehand, his own Banner of Austria reversed, as that which hathbeen dishonoured by theft and felony, and on the other, alance, bearing the bloody head of him who was his nearestcounsellor, or assistant, in this base injury. And say, that suchour behests being punctually discharged we will, for the sakeof our vow and the weal of the Holy Land, forgive his otherforfeits.??And how if the Duke of Austria deny all accession to thisact of wrong and of felony?? said Thomas de Vaux.?Tell him,? replied the King, ?we will prove it upon hisbody?ay, were he backed with his two bravest champions.Knightlike will we prove it, on foot or on horse, in the desertor in the field, time, place, and arms all at his own choice.??Bethink you of the peace of God and the church, myliege lord,? said the Baron of Gilsland, ?among those princesengaged in this holy Crusade.??Bethink you how to execute my commands, my liege vas-sal,? answered Richard impatiently. ?Methinks men expect toturn our purpose by their breath, as boys blow feathers to andfro. Peace of the church!  Who, I prithee, minds it? The peaceof the church, among Crusaders, implies war with the Saracens,with whom the princes have made truce; and the one endswith the other. And besides, see you not how every prince ofthem is seeking his own several ends? I will seek mine also?and that is honour. For honour I came hither; and if I may notwin it upon the Saracens, at least I will not lose a jot from anyrespect to this paltry Duke, though he were bulwarked andbuttressed by every prince in the Crusade.?De Vaux turned to obey the King?s mandate, shrugginghis shoulders at the same time, the bluntness of his nature 202The Talismanbeing unable to conceal that its tenor went against his judg-ment. But the hermit of Engaddi stepped forward, and as-sumed the air of one charged with higher commands thanthose of a mere earthly potentate. Indeed, his dress of shaggyskins, his uncombed and untrimmed hair and beard, his lean,wild, and contorted features, and the almost insane fire whichgleamed from under his bushy eyebrows, made him approachnearly to our idea of some seer of Scripture, who, chargedwith high mission to the sinful Kings of Judah or Israel, de-scended from the rocks and caverns in which he dwelt in ab-stracted solitude, to abash earthly tyrants in the midst of theirpride, by discharging on them the blighting denunciations ofDivine Majesty, even as the cloud discharges the lightningswith which it is fraught on the pinnacles and towers of castlesand palaces. In the midst of his most wayward mood, Richardrespected the church and its ministers; and though offendedat the intrusion of the hermit into his tent, he greeted himwith respect?at the same time, however, making a sign to SirThomas de Vaux to hasten on his message.But the hermit prohibited the baron, by gesture, look, andword, to stir a yard on such an errand; and holding up hisbare arm, from which the goatskin mantle fell back in theviolence of his action, he waved it aloft, meagre with famine,and wealed with the blows of the discipline.?In the name of God, and of the most holy Father, thevicegerent of the Christian Church upon earth, I prohibitthis most profane, bloodthirsty, and brutal defiance betwixttwo Christian princes, whose shoulders are signed with theblessed mark under which they swore brotherhood. Woe tohim by whom it is broken!?Richard of England, recall themost unhallowed message thou hast given to that baron.Danger and death are nigh thee!?the dagger is glancing atthy very throat!???Danger and death are playmates to Richard,? answeredthe Monarch proudly; ?and he hath braved too many swordsto fear a dagger.??Danger and death are near,? replied the seer, and sinkinghis voice to a hollow, unearthly tone, he added, ?And afterdeath the judgment!??Good and holy father,? said Richard, ?I reverence thy per-son and thy sanctity???Reverence not me!? interrupted the hermit; ?reverence 203Sir Walter Scottsooner the vilest insect that crawls by the shores of the DeadSea, and feeds upon its accursed slime. But reverence Himwhose commands I speak?reverence Him whose sepulchreyou have vowed to rescue?revere the oath of concord whichyou have sworn, and break not the silver cord of union andfidelity with which you have bound yourself to your princelyconfederates.??Good father,? said the King, ?you of the church seem tome to presume somewhat, if a layman may say so much,upon the dignity of your holy character. Without challeng-ing your right to take charge of our conscience, methinksyou might leave us the charge of our own honour.??Presume!? repeated the hermit. ?Is it for me to presume,royal Richard, who am but the bell obeying the hand of thesexton?but the senseless and worthless trumpet carryingthe command of him who sounds it? See, on my knees Ithrow myself before thee, imploring thee to have mercy onChristendom, on England, and on thyself!??Rise, rise,? said Richard, compelling him to stand up; ?itbeseems not that knees which are so frequently bended tothe Deity should press the ground in honour of man. Whatdanger awaits us, reverend father? and when stood the powerof England so low that the noisy bluster of this new-madeDuke?s displeasure should alarm her or her monarch???I have looked forth from my mountain turret upon thestarry host of heaven, as each in his midnight circuit utteredwisdom to another, and knowledge to the few who can under-stand their voice. There sits an enemy in thy House of Life,Lord King, malign at once to thy fame and thy prosperity?an emanation of Saturn, menacing thee with instant and bloodyperil, and which, but thou yield thy proud will to the rule ofthy duty, will presently crush thee even in thy pride.??Away, away?this is heathen science,? said the King.?Christians practise it not?wise men believe it not. Old man,thou dotest.??I dote not, Richard,? answered the hermit??I am not sohappy. I know my condition, and that some portion of rea-son is yet permitted me, not for my own use, but that of theChurch and the advancement of the Cross. I am the blindman who holds a torch to others, though it yields no light tohimself. Ask me touching what concerns the weal ofChristendom, and of this Crusade, and I will speak with 204The Talismanthee as the wisest counsellor on whose tongue persuasionever sat. Speak to me of my own wretched being, and mywords shall be those of the maniac outcast which I am.??I would not break the bands of unity asunder among theprinces of the Crusade,? said Richard, with a mitigated toneand manner; ?but what atonement can they render me forthe injustice and insult which I have sustained???Even of that I am prepared and commissioned to speakby the Council, which, meeting hastily at the summons ofPhilip of France, have taken measures for that effect.??Strange,? replied Richard, ?that others should treat of whatis due to the wounded majesty of England!??They are willing to anticipate your demands, if it be pos-sible,? answered the hermit. ?In a body, they consent thatthe Banner of England be replaced on Saint George?s Mount;and they lay under ban and condemnation the audaciouscriminal, or criminals, by whom it was outraged, and willannounce a princely reward to any who shall denounce thedelinquent?s guilt, and give his flesh to the wolves and ravens.??And Austria,? said Richard, ?upon whom rest such strongpresumptions that he was the author of the deed???To prevent discord in the host,? replied the hermit, ?Aus-tria will clear himself of the suspicion by submitting to what-soever ordeal the Patriarch of Jerusalem shall impose.??Will he clear himself by the trial by combat?? said KingRichard.?His oath prohibits it,? said the hermit; ?and, moreover,the Council of the Princes???Will neither authorize battle against the Saracens,? inter-rupted Richard, ?nor against any one else. But it is enough,father?thou hast shown me the folly of proceeding as I de-signed in this matter. You shall sooner light your torch in apuddle of rain than bring a spark out of a cold-blooded cow-ard. There is no honour to be gained on Austria, and so lethim pass. I will have him perjure himself, however; I willinsist on the ordeal. How I shall laugh to hear his clumsyfingers hiss, as he grasps the red-hot globe of iron! Ay, or hishuge mouth riven, and his gullet swelling to suffocation, ashe endeavours to swallow the consecrated bread!??Peace, Richard,? said the hermit??oh, peace, for shame,if not for charity! Who shall praise or honour princes whoinsult and calumniate each other? Alas! that a creature so 205Sir Walter Scottnoble as thou art?so accomplished in princely thoughts andprincely daring?so fitted to honour Christendom by thyactions, and, in thy calmer mood, to rule her by thy wis-dom, should yet have the brute and wild fury of the lionmingled with the dignity and courage of that king of theforest!?He remained an instant musing with his eyes fixed on theground, and then proceeded??But Heaven, that knows ourimperfect nature, accepts of our imperfect obedience, andhath delayed, though not averted, the bloody end of thydaring life. The destroying angel hath stood still, as of old bythe threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite, and the blade isdrawn in his hand, by which, at no distant date, Richard,the lion-hearted, shall be as low as the meanest peasant.??Must it, then, be so soon?? said Richard. ?Yet, even so beit. May my course be bright, if it be but brief!??Alas! noble King,? said the solitary, and it seemed as if atear (unwonted guest) were gathering in his dry and glazenedeye, ?short and melancholy, marked with mortification, andcalamity, and captivity, is the span that divides thee from thegrave which yawns for thee?a grave in which thou shalt belaid without lineage to succeed thee?without the tears of apeople, exhausted by thy ceaseless wars, to lament thee?without having extended the knowledge of thy subjects?without having done aught to enlarge their happiness.??But not without renown, monk?not without the tearsof the lady of my love! These consolations, which thou canstneither know nor estimate, await upon Richard to his grave.??Do I not know, can I not estimate the value of minstrel?spraise and of lady?s love?? retorted the hermit, in a tone whichfor a moment seemed to emulate the enthusiasm of Richardhimself. ?King of England,? he continued, extending his ema-ciated arm, ?the blood which boils in thy blue veins is notmore noble than that which stagnates in mine. Few and coldas the drops are, they still are of the blood of the royalLusignan?of the heroic and sainted Godfrey. I am?thatis, I was when in the world?Alberick Mortemar???Whose deeds,? said Richard, ?have so often filled Fame?strumpet! Is it so??can it be so? Could such a light as thinefall from the horizon of chivalry, and yet men be uncertainwhere its embers had alighted???Seek a fallen star,? said the hermit, ?and thou shalt only 206The Talismanlight on some foul jelly, which, in shooting through the ho-rizon, has assumed for a moment an appearance of splendour.Richard, if I thought that rending the bloody veil from myhorrible fate could make thy proud heart stoop to the disci-pline of the church, I could find in my heart to tell thee atale, which I have hitherto kept gnawing at my vitals in con-cealment, like the self-devoted youth of heathenesse. Listen,then, Richard, and may the grief and despair which cannotavail this wretched remnant of what was once a man be pow-erful as an example to so noble, yet so wild, a being as thouart! Yes?I will?I will tear open the long-hidden wounds,although in thy very presence they should bleed to death!?King Richard, upon whom the history of Alberick ofMortemar had made a deep impression in his early years,when minstrels were regaling his father?s halls with legendsof the Holy Land, listened with respect to the outlines of atale, which, darkly and imperfectly sketched, indicated suf-ficiently the cause of the partial insanity of this singular andmost unhappy being.?I need not,? he said, ?tell thee that I was noble in birth,high in fortune, strong in arms, wise in counsel. All these Iwas. But while the noblest ladies in Palestine strove whichshould wind garlands for my helmet, my love was fixed?unalterably and devotedly fixed?on a maiden of low de-gree. Her father, an ancient soldier of the Cross, saw ourpassion, and knowing the difference betwixt us, saw no otherrefuge for his daughter?s honour than to place her within theshadow of the cloister. I returned from a distant expedition,loaded with spoils and honour, to find my happiness wasdestroyed for ever! I too sought the cloister; and Satan, whohad marked me for his own, breathed into my heart a vapourof spiritual pride, which could only have had its source inhis own infernal regions. I had risen as high in the church asbefore in the state. I was, forsooth, the wise, the self-suffi-cient, the impeccable!?I was the counsellor of councils?Iwas the director of prelates. How should I stumble??where-fore should I fear temptation? Alas! I became confessor to asisterhood, and amongst that sisterhood I found the long-loved?the long-lost. Spare me further confession!?A fallennun, whose guilt was avenged by self-murder, sleeps soundlyin the vaults of Engaddi; while, above her very grave, gib-bers, moans, and roars a creature to whom but so much rea- 207Sir Walter Scottson is left as may suffice to render him completely sensibleto his fate!??Unhappy man!? said Richard, ?I wonder no longer at thymisery. How didst thou escape the doom which the canonsdenounce against thy offence???Ask one who is yet in the gall of worldly bitterness,? saidthe hermit, ?and he will speak of a life spared for personalrespects, and from consideration to high birth. But, Rich-ard, I tell thee that Providence hath preserved me to lift meon high as a light and beacon, whose ashes, when this earthlyfuel is burnt out, must yet be flung into Tophet. Witheredand shrunk as this poor form is, it is yet animated with twospirits?one active, shrewd, and piercing, to advocate thecause of the Church of Jerusalem; one mean, abject, anddespairing, fluctuating between madness and misery, tomourn over my own wretchedness, and to guard holy relicson which it would be most sinful for me even to cast my eye.Pity me not!?it is but sin to pity the loss of such an abject;pity me not, but profit by my example. Thou standest onthe highest, and, therefore, on the most dangerous pinnacleoccupied by any Christian prince. Thou art proud of heart,loose of life, bloody of hand. Put from thee the sins whichare to thee as daughters?though they be dear to the sinfulAdam, expel these adopted furies from thy breast?thy pride,thy luxury, thy bloodthirstiness.??He raves,? said Richard, turning from the solitary to DeVaux, as one who felt some pain from a sarcasm which yethe could not resent; then turned him calmly, and somewhatscornfully, to the anchoret, as he replied, ?Thou hast founda fair bevy of daughters, reverend father, to one who hathbeen but few months married; but since I must put themfrom my roof, it were but like a father to provide them withsuitable matches. Therefore, I will part with my pride to thenoble canons of the church?my luxury, as thou callest it, tothe monks of the rule?and my bloodthirstiness to theKnights of the Temple.??O heart of steel, and hand of iron,? said the anchoret,?upon whom example, as well as advice, is alike thrown away!Yet shalt thou be spared for a season, in case it so be thoushouldst turn, and do that which is acceptable in the sight ofHeaven. For me I must return to my place. Kyrie Eleison! Iam he through whom the rays of heavenly grace dart like 208The Talismanthose of the sun through a burning-glass, concentrating themon other objects, until they kindle and blaze, while the glassitself remains cold and uninfluenced. Kyrie Eleison!?thepoor must be called, for the rich have refused the banquet?Kyrie Eleison!?So saying, he burst from the tent, uttering loud cries.?A mad priest!? said Richard, from whose mind the franticexclamations of the hermit had partly obliterated the im-pression produced by the detail of his personal history andmisfortunes. ?After him, De Vaux, and see he comes to noharm; for, Crusaders as we are, a juggler hath more rever-ence amongst our varlets than a priest or a saint, and theymay, perchance, put some scorn upon him.?The knight obeyed, and Richard presently gave way to thethoughts which the wild prophecy of the monk had inspired.?To die early?without lineage?without lamentation! Aheavy sentence, and well that it is not passed by a more com-petent judge. Yet the Saracens, who are accomplished inmystical knowledge, will often maintain that He, in whoseeyes the wisdom of the sage is but as folly, inspires wisdomand prophecy into the seeming folly of the madman. Yonderhermit is said to read the stars, too, an art generally practisedin these lands, where the heavenly host was of yore the ob-ject of idolatry. I would I had asked him touching the loss ofmy banner; for not the blessed Tishbite, the founder of hisorder, could seem more wildly rapt out of himself, or speakwith a tongue more resembling that of a prophet.?Hownow, De Vaux, what news of the mad priest???Mad priest, call you him, my lord?? answered De Vaux.?Methinks he resembles more the blessed Baptist himself,just issued from the wilderness. He has placed himself onone of the military engines, and from thence he preaches tothe soldiers as never man preached since the time of Peterthe Hermit. The camp, alarmed by his cries, crowd aroundhim in thousands; and breaking off every now and then fromthe main thread of his discourse, he addresses the severalnations, each in their own language, and presses upon eachthe arguments best qualified to urge them to perseverance inthe delivery of Palestine.??By this light, a noble hermit!? said King Richard. ?Butwhat else could come from the blood of Godfrey? He despairof safety, because he hath in former days lived paramours? I 209Sir Walter Scottwill have the Pope send him an ample remission, and I wouldnot less willingly be intercessor had his belle amie been anabbess.?As he spoke, the Archbishop of Tyre craved audience, forthe purpose of requesting Richard?s attendance, should hishealth permit, on a secret conclave of the chiefs of the Cru-sade, and to explain to him the military and political inci-dents which had occurred during his illness.CHAPTER XIX.Must we then sheathe our still victorious sword;Turn back our forward step, which ever trodO?er foemen?s necks the onward path of glory;Unclasp the mail, which with a solemn vow,In God?s own house, we hung upon our shoulders?That vow, as unaccomplish?d as the promiseWhich village nurses make to still their children,And after think no more of?The Crusade, A Tragedy.THE ARCHBISHOP OF TYRE was an emissary well chosen tocommunicate to Richard tidings, which from another voicethe lion-hearted King would not have brooked to hear with-out the most unbounded explosions of resentment. Even thissagacious and reverend prelate found difficulty in inducinghim to listen to news which destroyed all his hopes of gain-ing back the Holy Sepulchre by force of arms, and acquiringthe renown which the universal all-hail of Christendom was 210The Talismanready to confer upon him as the Champion of the Cross.But, by the Archbishop?s report, it appeared that Saladinwas assembling all the force of his hundred tribes, and thatthe monarchs of Europe, already disgusted from various mo-tives with the expedition, which had proved so hazardous,and was daily growing more so, had resolved to abandontheir purpose. In this they were countenanced by the ex-ample of Philip of France, who, with many protestations ofregard, and assurances that he would first see his brother ofEngland in safety, declared his intention to return to Eu-rope. His great vassal, the Earl of Champagne, had adoptedthe same resolution; and it could not excite surprise thatLeopold of Austria, affronted as he had been by Richard,was glad to embrace an opportunity of deserting a cause inwhich his haughty opponent was to be considered as chief.Others announced the same purpose; so that it was plainthat the King of England was to be left, if he chose to re-main, supported only by such volunteers as might, undersuch depressing circumstances, join themselves to the En-glish army, and by the doubtful aid of Conrade of Montserratand the military orders of the Temple and of Saint John,who, though they were sworn to wage battle against theSaracens, were at least equally jealous of any European mon-arch achieving the conquest of Palestine, where, with short-sighted and selfish policy, they proposed to establish inde-pendent dominions of their own.It needed not many arguments to show Richard the truth ofhis situation; and indeed, after his first burst of passion, he sathim calmly down, and with gloomy looks, head depressed,and arms folded on his bosom, listened to the Archbishop?sreasoning on the impossibility of his carrying on the Crusadewhen deserted by his companions. Nay, he forbore interrup-tion, even when the prelate ventured, in measured terms, tohint that Richard?s own impetuosity had been one main causeof disgusting the princes with the expedition.?Confiteor,? answered Richard, with a dejected look, andsomething of a melancholy smile??I confess, reverend fa-ther, that I ought on some accounts to sing culpa mea. But isit not hard that my frailties of temper should be visited withsuch a penance?that, for a burst or two of natural passion,I should be doomed to see fade before me ungathered such arich harvest of glory to God and honour to chivalry? But it 211Sir Walter Scottshall not fade. By the soul of the Conqueror, I will plant theCross on the towers of Jerusalem, or it shall be planted overRichard?s grave!??Thou mayest do it,? said the prelate, ?yet not anotherdrop of Christian blood be shed in the quarrel.??Ah, you speak of compromise, Lord Prelate; but the bloodof the infidel hounds must also cease to flow,? said Richard.?There will be glory enough,? replied the Archbishop, ?inhaving extorted from Saladin, by force of arms, and by therespect inspired by your fame, such conditions as at oncerestore the Holy Sepulchre, open the Holy Land to pilgrims,secure their safety by strong fortresses, and, stronger thanall, assure the safety of the Holy City, by conferring on Rich-ard the title of King Guardian of Jerusalem.??How!? said Richard, his eyes sparkling with unusual light.?I?I?I the King Guardian of the Holy City! Victory itself,but that it is victory, could not gain more?scarce so much,when won with unwilling and disunited forces. But Saladinstill proposes to retain his interest in the Holy Land???As a joint sovereign, the sworn ally,? replied the prelate,?of the mighty Richard?his relative, if it may be permitted,by marriage.??By marriage!? said Richard, surprised, yet less so than theprelate had expected. ?Ha!?ay?Edith Plantagenet. Did Idream this? or did some one tell me? My head is still weak fromthis fever, and has been agitated. Was it the Scot, or the Hakim,or yonder holy hermit, that hinted such a wild bargain???The hermit of Engaddi, most likely,? said the Archbishop,?for he hath toiled much in this matter; and since the dis-content of the princes has became apparent, and a separa-tion of their forces unavoidable, he hath had many consulta-tions, both with Christian and pagan, for arranging such apacification as may give to Christendom, at least in part, theobjects of this holy warfare.??My kinswoman to an infidel?ha!? exclaimed Richard,as his eyes began to sparkle.The prelate hastened to avert his wrath.?The Pope?s consent must doubtless be first attained, andthe holy hermit, who is well known at Rome, will treat withthe holy Father.??How??without our consent first given?? said the King.?Surely no,? said the Bishop, in a quieting and insinuating 212The Talismantone of voice??only with and under your especial sanction.??My sanction to marry my kinswoman to an infidel!? saidRichard; yet he spoke rather in a tone of doubt than as dis-tinctly reprobating the measure proposed. ?Could I havedreamed of such a composition when I leaped upon the Syr-ian shore from the prow of my galley, even as a lion springs onhis prey! And now?But proceed?I will hear with patience.?Equally delighted and surprised to find his task so mucheasier than he had apprehended, the Archbishop hastenedto pour forth before Richard the instances of such alliancesin Spain?not without countenance from the Holy See; theincalculable advantages which all Christendom would de-rive from the union of Richard and Saladin by a bond sosacred; and, above all, he spoke with great vehemence andunction on the probability that Saladin would, in case of theproposed alliance, exchange his false faith for the true one.?Hath the Soldan shown any disposition to become Chris-tian?? said Richard. ?If so, the king lives not on earth towhom I would grant the hand of a kinswoman, ay, or sister,sooner than to my noble Saladin?ay, though the one cameto lay crown and sceptre at her feet, and the other had noth-ing to offer but his good sword and better heart!??Saladin hath heard our Christian teachers,? said theBishop, somewhat evasively??my unworthy self, and oth-ers?and as he listens with patience, and replies with calm-ness, it can hardly be but that he be snatched as a brandfrom the burning. Magna est veritas, et prevalebit! moreover,the hermit of Engaddi, few of whose words have fallen fruit-less to the ground, is possessed fully with the belief that thereis a calling of the Saracens and the other heathen approach-ing, to which this marriage shall be matter of induction. Hereadeth the course of the stars; and dwelling, with macera-tion of the flesh, in those divine places which the saints havetrodden of old, the spirit of Elijah the Tishbite, the founderof his blessed order, hath been with him as it was with theprophet Elisha, the son of Shaphat, when he spread his mantleover him.?King Richard listened to the Prelate?s reasoning with adowncast brow and a troubled look.?I cannot tell,? he said, ?How, it is with me, but methinksthese cold counsels of the Princes of Christendom have in-fected me too with a lethargy of spirit. The time hath been 213Sir Walter Scottthat, had a layman proposed such alliance to me, I had struckhim to earth?if a churchman, I had spit at him as a ren-egade and priest of Baal; yet now this counsel sounds not sostrange in mine ear. For why should I not seek for brother-hood and alliance with a Saracen, brave, just, generous?who loves and honours a worthy foe, as if he were a friend?whilst the Princes of Christendom shrink from the side oftheir allies, and forsake the cause of Heaven and good knight-hood? But I will possess my patience, and will not think ofthem. Only one attempt will I make to keep this gallantbrotherhood together, if it be possible; and if I fail, LordArchbishop, we will speak together of thy counsel, which, asnow, I neither accept nor altogether reject. Wend we to theCouncil, my lord?the hour calls us. Thou sayest Richard ishasty and proud?thou shalt see him humble himself likethe lowly broom-plant from which he derives his surname.?With the assistance of those of his privy chamber, the Kingthen hastily robed himself in a doublet and mantle of a darkand uniform colour; and without any mark of regal dignity,excepting a ring of gold upon his head, he hastened with theArchbishop of Tyre to attend the Council, which waited buthis presence to commence its sitting.The pavilion of the Council was an ample tent, havingbefore it the large Banner of the Cross displayed, and an-other, on which was portrayed a female kneeling, with di-shevelled hair and disordered dress, meant to represent thedesolate and distressed Church of Jerusalem, and bearingthe motto, afflict? spons? ne obliviscaris. Warders, carefullyselected, kept every one at a distance from the neighbourhoodof this tent, lest the debates, which were sometimes of a loudand stormy character, should reach other ears than those theywere designed for.Here, therefore, the princes of the Crusade were assembledawaiting Richard?s arrival. And even the brief delay whichwas thus interposed was turned to his disadvantage by hisenemies, various instances being circulated of his pride andundue assumption of superiority, of which even the neces-sity of the present short pause was quoted as an instance.Men strove to fortify each other in their evil opinion of theKing of England, and vindicated the offence which each hadtaken, by putting the most severe construction upon circum-stances the most trifling; and all this, perhaps, because they 214The Talismanwere conscious of an instinctive reverence for the heroicmonarch, which it would require more than ordinary effortsto overcome.They had settled, accordingly, that they should receive himon his entrance with slight notice, and no more respect thanwas exactly necessary to keep within the bounds of cold cer-emonial. But when they beheld that noble form, that princelycountenance, somewhat pale from his late illness? the eyewhich had been called by minstrels the bright star of battleand victory?when his feats, almost surpassing humanstrength and valour, rushed on their recollection, the Coun-cil of Princes simultaneously arose?even the jealous Kingof France and the sullen and offended Duke of Austria?arose with one consent, and the assembled princes burst forthwith one voice in the acclamation, ?God save King Richardof England! Long life to the valiant Lion?s-heart!?With a countenance frank and open as the summer sunwhen it rises, Richard distributed his thanks around, andcongratulated himself on being once more among his royalbrethren of the Crusade.?Some brief words he desired to say,? such was his addressto the assembly, ?though on a subject so unworthy as him-self, even at the risk of delaying for a few minutes their con-sultations for the weal of Christendom and the advancementof their holy enterprise.?The assembled princes resumed their seats, and there wasa profound silence.?This day,? continued the King of England, ?is a high fes-tival of the church, and it well becomes Christian men, atsuch a tide, to reconcile themselves with their brethren, andconfess their faults to each other. Noble princes and fathersof this holy expedition, Richard is a soldier?his hand is everreadier than his tongue?and his tongue is but too muchused to the rough language of his trade. But do not, forPlantagenet?s hasty speeches and ill-considered actions, for-sake the noble cause of the redemption of Palestine?do notthrow away earthly renown and eternal salvation, to be wonhere if ever they can be won by man, because the act of asoldier may have been hasty, and his speech as hard as theiron which he has worn from childhood. Is Richard in de-fault to any of you, Richard will make compensation bothby word and action.?Noble brother of France, have I been 215Sir Walter Scottso unlucky as to offend you???The Majesty of France has no atonement to seek fromthat of England,? answered Philip, with kingly dignity, ac-cepting, at the same time, the offered hand of Richard; ?andwhatever opinion I may adopt concerning the prosecutionof this enterprise will depend on reasons arising out of thestate of my own kingdom?certainly on no jealousy or dis-gust at my royal and most valorous brother.??Austria,? said Richard, walking up to the Archduke, witha mixture of frankness and dignity, while Leopold arose fromhis seat, as if involuntarily, and with the action of an au-tomaton, whose motions depended upon some external im-pulse??Austria thinks he hath reason to be offended withEngland; England, that he hath cause to complain of Aus-tria. Let them exchange forgiveness, that the peace of Eu-rope and the concord of this host may remain unbroken. Weare now joint supporters of a more glorious banner than everblazed before an earthly prince, even the Banner of Salva-tion. Let not, therefore, strife be betwixt us for the symbol ofour more worldly dignities; but let Leopold restore the pen-non of England, if he has it in his power, and Richard willsay, though from no motive save his love for Holy Church,that he repents him of the hasty mood in which he did insultthe standard of Austria.?The Archduke stood still, sullen and discontented, withhis eyes fixed on the floor, and his countenance loweringwith smothered displeasure, which awe, mingled with awk-wardness, prevented his giving vent to in words.The Patriarch of Jerusalem hastened to break the embar-rassing silence, and to bear witness for the Archduke of Aus-tria that he had exculpated himself, by a solemn oath, fromall knowledge, direct or indirect, of the aggression done tothe Banner of England.?Then we have done the noble Archduke the greaterwrong,? said Richard; ?and craving his pardon for imputingto him an outrage so cowardly, we extend our hand to himin token of renewed peace and amity. But how is this? Aus-tria refuses our uncovered hand, as he formerly refused ourmailed glove? What! are we neither to be his mate in peacenor his antagonist in war? Well, let it be so. We will take theslight esteem in which he holds us as a penance for aughtwhich we may have done against him in heat of blood, and 216The Talismanwill therefore hold the account between us cleared.?So saying, he turned from the Archduke with an air ratherof dignity than scorn, leaving the Austrian apparently as muchrelieved by the removal of his eye as is a sullen and truantschoolboy when the glance of his severe pedagogue is with-drawn.?Noble Earl of Champagne?princely Marquis ofMontserrat?valiant Grand Master of the Templars?I amhere a penitent in the confessional. Do any of you bring acharge or claim amends from me???I know not on what we could ground any,? said thesmooth-tongued Conrade, ?unless it were that the King ofEngland carries off from his poor brothers of the war allthe fame which they might have hoped to gain in the expe-dition.??My charge, if I am called on to make one,? said the Mas-ter of the Templars, ?is graver and deeper than that of theMarquis of Montserrat. It may be thought ill to beseem amilitary monk such as I to raise his voice where so manynoble princes remain silent; but it concerns our whole host,and not least this noble King of England, that he shouldhear from some one to his face those charges which there areenow to bring against him in his absence. We laud and honourthe courage and high achievements of the King of England;but we feel aggrieved that he should on all occasions seizeand maintain a precedence and superiority over us, which itbecomes not independent princes to submit to. Much wemight yield of our free will to his bravery, his zeal, his wealth,and his power; but he who snatches all as matter of right,and leaves nothing to grant out of courtesy and favour, de-grades us from allies into retainers and vassals, and sullies inthe eyes of our soldiers and subjects the lustre of our author-ity, which is no longer independently exercised. Since theroyal Richard has asked the truth from us, he must neitherbe surprised nor angry when he hears one, to whom worldlypomp is prohibited, and secular authority is nothing, savingso far as it advances the prosperity of God?s Temple, and theprostration of the lion which goeth about seeking whom hemay devour?when he hears, I say, such a one as I tell himthe truth in reply to his question; which truth, even while Ispeak it, is, I know, confirmed by the heart of every one whohears me, however respect may stifle their voices.? 217Sir Walter ScottRichard coloured very highly while the Grand Master wasmaking this direct and unvarnished attack upon his con-duct, and the murmur of assent which followed it showedplainly that almost all who were present acquiesced in thejustice of the accusation. Incensed, and at the same timemortified, he yet foresaw that to give way to his headlongresentment would be to give the cold and wary accuser theadvantage over him which it was the Templar?s principalobject to obtain. He therefore, with a strong effort, remainedsilent till he had repeated a pater noster, being the coursewhich his confessor had enjoined him to pursue when angerwas likely to obtain dominion over him. The King then spokewith composure, though not without an embittered tone,especially at the outset:??And is it even so? And are our brethren at such pains tonote the infirmities of our natural temper, and the roughprecipitance of our zeal, which may sometimes have urgedus to issue commands when there was little time to holdcouncil? I could not have thought that offences, casual andunpremeditated like mine, could find such deep root in thehearts of my allies in this most holy cause; that for my sakethey should withdraw their hands from the plough whenthe furrow was near the end?for my sake turn aside fromthe direct path to Jerusalem, which their swords have opened.I vainly thought that my small services might have out-weighed my rash errors?that if it were remembered that Ipressed to the van in an assault, it would not be forgottenthat I was ever the last in the retreat?that, if I elevated mybanner upon conquered fields of battle, it was all the advan-tage that I sought, while others were dividing the spoil. Imay have called the conquered city by my name, but it wasto others that I yielded the dominion. If I have been head-strong in urging bold counsels, I have not, methinks, sparedmy own blood or my people?s in carrying them into as boldexecution; or if I have, in the hurry of march or battle, as-sumed a command over the soldiers of others, such havebeen ever treated as my own when my wealth purchased theprovisions and medicines which their own sovereigns couldnot procure. But it shames me to remind you of what all butmyself seem to have forgotten. Let us rather look forward toour future measures; and believe me, brethren,? he contin-ued, his face kindling with eagerness, ?you shall not find the 218The Talismanpride, or the wrath, or the ambition of Richard a stumbling-block of offence in the path to which religion and glory sum-mon you as with the trumpet of an archangel. Oh, no, no!never would I survive the thought that my frailties and infir-mities had been the means to sever this goodly fellowship ofassembled princes. I would cut off my left hand with myright, could my doing so attest my sincerity. I will yield up,voluntarily, all right to command in the host?even mineown liege subjects. They shall be led by such sovereigns asyou may nominate; and their King, ever but too apt to ex-change the leader?s baton for the adventurer?s lance, will serveunder the banner of Beau-Seant among the Templars?ay,or under that of Austria, if Austria will name a brave man tolead his forces. Or if ye are yourselves a-weary of this war,and feel your armour chafe your tender bodies, leave butwith Richard some ten or fifteen thousand of your soldiersto work out the accomplishment of your vow; and whenZion is won,? he exclaimed, waving his hand aloft, as if dis-playing the standard of the Cross over Jerusalem??whenZion is won, we will write upon her gates, not the name ofRichard Plantagenet, but of those generous princes who en-trusted him with the means of conquest!?The rough eloquence and determined expression of themilitary monarch at once roused the drooping spirits of theCrusaders, reanimated their devotion, and, fixing their at-tention on the principal object of the expedition, made mostof them who were present blush for having been moved bysuch petty subjects of complaint as had before engrossedthem. Eye caught fire from eye, voice lent courage to voice.They resumed, as with one accord, the war-cry with whichthe sermon of Peter the Hermit was echoed back, and shoutedaloud, ?Lead us on, gallant Lion?s-heart; none so worthy tolead where brave men follow. Lead us on?to Jerusalem?toJerusalem! It is the will of God?it is the will of God! Blessedis he who shall lend an arm to its fulfilment!?The shout, so suddenly and generally raised, was heardbeyond the ring of sentinels who guarded the pavilion ofCouncil, and spread among the soldiers of the host, who,inactive and dispirited by disease and climate, had begun,like their leaders, to droop in resolution; but the reappear-ance of Richard in renewed vigour, and the well-known shoutwhich echoed from the assembly of the princes, at once re- 219Sir Walter Scottkindled their enthusiasm, and thousands and tens of thou-sands answered with the same shout of ?Zion, Zion! War,war! Instant battle with the infidels! It is the will of God?itis the will of God!?The acclamations from without increased in their turn theenthusiasm which prevailed within the pavilion. Those whodid not actually catch the flame were afraid?at least for thetime?to seem colder than others. There was no more speechexcept of a proud advance towards Jerusalem upon the ex-piry of the truce, and the measures to be taken in the mean-time for supplying and recruiting the army. The Councilbroke up, all apparently filled with the same enthusiasticpurpose?which, however, soon faded in the bosom of most,and never had an existence in that of others.Of the latter class were the Marquis Conrade and the GrandMaster of the Templars, who retired together to their quar-ters ill at ease, and malcontent with the events of the day.?I ever told it to thee,? said the latter, with the cold, sar-donic expression peculiar to him, ?that Richard would burstthrough the flimsy wiles you spread for him, as would a lionthrough a spider?s web. Thou seest he has but to speak, andhis breath agitates these fickle fools as easily as the whirl-wind catcheth scattered straws, and sweeps them together,or disperses them at its pleasure.??When the blast has passed away,? said Conrade, ?thestraws, which it made dance to its pipe, will settle to earthagain.??But knowest thou not besides,? said the Templar, ?that itseems, if this new purpose of conquest shall be abandonedand pass away, and each mighty prince shall again be left tosuch guidance as his own scanty brain can supply, Richardmay yet probably become King of Jerusalem by compact,and establish those terms of treaty with the Soldan whichthou thyself thought?st him so likely to spurn at???Now, by Mahound and Termagaunt, for Christian oathsare out of fashion,? said Conrade, ?sayest thou the proudKing of England would unite his blood with a heathenSoldan? My policy threw in that ingredient to make the wholetreaty an abomination to him. As bad for us that he becomeour master by an agreement, as by victory.??Thy policy hath ill calculated Richard?s digestion,? an-swered the Templar; ?I know his mind by a whisper from 220The Talismanthe Archbishop. And then thy master-stroke respecting yon-der banner?it has passed off with no more respect than twocubits of embroidered silk merited. Marquis Conrade, thywit begins to halt; I will trust thy finespun measures no longer,but will try my own. Knowest thou not the people whomthe Saracens call Charegites???Surely,? answered the Marquis; ?they are desperate andbesotted enthusiasts, who devote their lives to the advance-ment of religion?somewhat like Templars, only they arenever known to pause in the race of their calling.??Jest not,? answered the scowling monk. ?Know that oneof these men has set down in his bloody vow the name of theIsland Emperor yonder, to be hewn down as the chief en-emy of the Moslem faith.??A most judicious paynim,? said Conrade. ?MayMohammed send him his paradise for a reward!??He was taken in the camp by one of our squires, and inprivate examination frankly avowed his fixed and determinedpurpose to me,? said the Grand Master.?Now the heavens pardon them who prevented the pur-pose of this most judicious Charegite!? answered Conrade.?He is my prisoner,? added the Templar, ?and secludedfrom speech with others, as thou mayest suppose; but pris-ons have been broken???Chains left unlocked, and captives have escaped,? an-swered the Marquis. ?It is an ancient saying, no sure dun-geon but the grave.??When loose, he resumes his quest,? continued the mili-tary priest; ?for it is the nature of this sort of blood houndnever to quit the slot of the prey he has once scented.??Say no more of it,? said the Marquis; ?I see thy policy?it is dreadful, but the emergency is imminent.??I only told thee of it,? said the Templar, ?that thou mayestkeep thyself on thy guard; for the uproar will be dreadful,and there is no knowing on whom the English may venttheir rage. Ay, and there is another risk. My page knows thecounsels of this Charegite,? he continued; ?and, moreover,he is a peevish, self-willed fool, whom I would I were rid of,as he thwarts me by presuming to see with his own eyes, notmine. But our holy order gives me power to put a remedy tosuch inconvenience. Or stay?the Saracen may find a gooddagger in his cell, and I warrant you he uses it as he breaks 221Sir Walter Scottforth, which will be of a surety so soon as the page enterswith his food.??It will give the affair a colour,? said Conrade; ?and yet???Yet and but,? said the Templar, ?are words for fools; wisemen neither hesitate nor retract?they resolve and they ex-ecute.?CHAPTER XX.When beauty leads the lion in her toils,Such are her charms, he dare not raise his mane,Far less expand the terror of his fangs.So great Alcides made his club a distaff,And spun to please fair Omphale.Anonymous.RICHARD, the unsuspicious object of the dark treachery de-tailed in the closing part of the last chapter, having effected,for the present at least, the triumphant union of the Crusad-ing princes in a resolution to prosecute the war with vigour,had it next at heart to establish tranquillity in his own fam-ily; and, now that he could judge more temperately, to in-quire distinctly into the circumstances leading to the loss ofhis banner, and the nature and the extent of the connectionbetwixt his kinswoman Edith and the banished adventurerfrom Scotland.Accordingly, the Queen and her household were startled 222The Talismanwith a visit from Sir Thomas de Vaux, requesting the presentattendance of the Lady Calista of Montfaucon, the Queen?sprincipal bower-woman, upon King Richard.?What am I to say, madam?? said the trembling attendantto the Queen, ?He will slay us all.??Nay, fear not, madam,? said De Vaux. ?His Majesty hathspared the life of the Scottish knight, who was the chief of-fender, and bestowed him upon the Moorish physician. Hewill not be severe upon a lady, though faulty.??Devise some cunning tale, wench,? said Berengaria. ?Myhusband hath too little time to make inquiry into the truth.??Tell the tale as it really happened,? said Edith, ?lest I tellit for thee.??With humble permission of her Majesty,? said De Vaux,?I would say Lady Edith adviseth well; for although KingRichard is pleased to believe what it pleases your Grace totell him, yet I doubt his having the same deference for theLady Calista, and in this especial matter.??The Lord of Gilsland is right,? said the Lady Calista, muchagitated at the thoughts of the investigation which was totake place; ?and besides, if I had presence of mind enough toforge a plausible story, beshrew me if I think I should havethe courage to tell it.?In this candid humour, the Lady Calista was conducted byDe Vaux to the King, and made, as she had proposed, a fullconfession of the decoy by which the unfortunate Knight ofthe Leopard had been induced to desert his post; exculpat-ing the Lady Edith, who, she was aware, would not fail toexculpate herself, and laying the full burden on the Queen,her mistress, whose share of the frolic, she well knew, wouldappear the most venial in the eyes of Coeur de Lion. In truth,Richard was a fond, almost a uxorious husband. The firstburst of his wrath had long since passed away, and he wasnot disposed severely to censure what could not now beamended. The wily Lady Calista, accustomed from her ear-liest childhood to fathom the intrigues of a court, and watchthe indications of a sovereign?s will, hastened back to theQueen with the speed of a lapwing, charged with the King?scommands that she should expect a speedy visit from him;to which the bower-lady added a commentary founded onher own observation, tending to show that Richard meantjust to preserve so much severity as might bring his royal 223Sir Walter Scottconsort to repent of her frolic, and then to extend to her andall concerned his gracious pardon.?Sits the wind in that corner, wench?? said the Queen,much relieved by this intelligence. ?Believe me that, greatcommander as he is, Richard will find it hard to circumventus in this matter, and that, as the Pyrenean shepherds arewont to say in my native Navarre, Many a one comes forwool, and goes back shorn.?Having possessed herself of all the information whichCalista could communicate, the royal Berengaria arrayedherself in her most becoming dress, and awaited with confi-dence the arrival of the heroic Richard.He arrived, and found himself in the situation of a princeentering an offending province, in the confidence that hisbusiness will only be to inflict rebuke, and receive submis-sion, when he unexpectedly finds it in a state of completedefiance and insurrection. Berengaria well knew the powerof her charms and the extent of Richard?s affection, and feltassured that she could make her own terms good, now thatthe first tremendous explosion of his anger had expendeditself without mischief. Far from listening to the King?s in-tended rebuke, as what the levity of her conduct had justlydeserved, she extenuated, nay, defended as a harmless frolic,that which she was accused of. She denied, indeed, with manya pretty form of negation, that she had directed Nectabanusabsolutely to entice the knight farther than the brink of theMount on which he kept watch?and, indeed, this was sofar true, that she had not designed Sir Kenneth to be intro-duced into her tent?and then, eloquent in urging her owndefence, the Queen was far more so in pressing upon Rich-ard the charge of unkindness, in refusing her so poor a boonas the life of an unfortunate knight, who, by her thoughtlessprank, had been brought within the danger of martial law.She wept and sobbed while she enlarged on her husband?sobduracy on this score, as a rigour which had threatened tomake her unhappy for life, whenever she should reflect thatshe had given, unthinkingly, the remote cause for such a trag-edy. The vision of the slaughtered victim would have hauntedher dreams?nay, for aught she knew, since such things of-ten happened, his actual spectre might have stood by herwaking couch. To all this misery of the mind was she ex-posed by the severity of one who, while he pretended to dote 224The Talismanupon her slightest glance, would not forego one act of poorrevenge, though the issue was to render her miserable.All this flow of female eloquence was accompanied withthe usual arguments of tears and sighs, and uttered with suchtone and action as seemed to show that the Queen?s resent-ment arose neither from pride nor sullenness, but from feel-ings hurt at finding her consequence with her husband lessthan she had expected to possess.The good King Richard was considerably embarrassed. Hetried in vain to reason with one whose very jealousy of hisaffection rendered her incapable of listening to argument,nor could he bring himself to use the restraint of lawful au-thority to a creature so beautiful in the midst of her unrea-sonable displeasure. He was therefore reduced to the defen-sive, endeavoured gently to chide her suspicions and sootheher displeasure, and recalled to her mind that she need notlook back upon the past with recollections either of remorseor supernatural fear, since Sir Kenneth was alive and well,and had been bestowed by him upon the great Arabian phy-sician, who, doubtless, of all men, knew best how to keephim living. But this seemed the unkindest cut of all, and theQueen?s sorrow was renewed at the idea of a Saracen?amediciner?obtaining a boon for which, with bare head andon bended knee, she had petitioned her husband in vain. Atthis new charge Richard?s patience began rather to give way,and he said, in a serious tone of voice, ?Berengaria, the phy-sician saved my life. If it is of value in your eyes, you will notgrudge him a higher recompense than the only one I couldprevail on him to accept.?The Queen was satisfied she had urged her coquettish dis-pleasure to the verge of safety.?My Richard,? she said, ?why brought you not that sage tome, that England?s Queen might show how she esteemedhim who could save from extinction the lamp of chivalry,the glory of England, and the light of poor Berengaria?s lifeand hope??In a word, the matrimonial dispute was ended; but, thatsome penalty might be paid to justice, both King and Queenaccorded in laying the whole blame on the agent Nectabanus,who (the Queen being by this time well weary of the poordwarf?s humour) was, with his royal consort Guenevra, sen-tenced to be banished from the Court; and the unlucky dwarf 225Sir Walter Scottonly escaped a supplementary whipping, from the Queen?sassurances that he had already sustained personal chastise-ment. It was decreed further that, as an envoy was shortly tobe dispatched to Saladin, acquainting him with the resolu-tion of the Council to resume hostilities so soon as the trucewas ended, and as Richard proposed to send a valuable presentto the Soldan, in acknowledgment of the high benefit hehad derived from the services of El Hakim, the two unhappycreatures should be added to it as curiosities, which, fromtheir extremely grotesque appearance, and the shattered stateof their intellect, were gifts that might well pass betweensovereign and sovereign.Richard had that day yet another female encounter to sus-tain; but he advanced to it with comparative indifference,for Edith, though beautiful and highly esteemed by her royalrelative?nay, although she had from his unjust suspicionsactually sustained the injury of which Berengaria only af-fected to complain?still was neither Richard?s wife nor mis-tress, and he feared her reproaches less, although founded inreason, than those of the Queen, though unjust andfantastical. Having requested to speak with her apart, he wasushered into her apartment, adjoining that of the Queen,whose two female Coptish slaves remained on their knees inthe most remote corner during the interview. A thin blackveil extended its ample folds over the tall and graceful formof the high-born maiden, and she wore not upon her personany female ornament of what kind soever. She arose and madea low reverence when Richard entered, resumed her seat athis command, and, when he sat down beside her, waited,without uttering a syllable, until he should communicate hispleasure.Richard, whose custom it was to be familiar with Edith, astheir relationship authorized, felt this reception chilling, andopened the conversation with some embarrassment.?Our fair cousin,? he at length said, ?is angry with us; andwe own that strong circumstances have induced us, withoutcause, to suspect her of conduct alien to what we have everknown in her course of life. But while we walk in this mistyvalley of humanity, men will mistake shadows for substances.Can my fair cousin not forgive her somewhat vehement kins-man Richard???Who can refuse forgiveness to Richard,? answered Edith, 226The Talisman?provided Richard can obtain pardon of the King???Come, my kinswoman,? replied Coeur de Lion, ?this isall too solemn. By Our Lady, such a melancholy counte-nance, and this ample sable veil, might make men thinkthou wert a new-made widow, or had lost a betrothed lover,at least. Cheer up! Thou hast heard, doubtless, that there isno real cause for woe; why, then, keep up the form ofmourning???For the departed honour of Plantagenet?for the glorywhich hath left my father?s house.?Richard frowned. ?Departed honour! glory which hath leftour house!? he repeated angrily. ?But my cousin Edith isprivileged. I have judged her too hastily; she has therefore aright to deem of me too harshly. But tell me at least in whatI have faulted.??Plantagenet,? said Edith, ?should have either pardonedan offence, or punished it. It misbecomes him to assign freemen, Christians, and brave knights, to the fetters of the infi-dels. It becomes him not to compromise and barter, or togrunt life under the forfeiture of liberty. To have doomedthe unfortunate to death might have been severity, but had ashow of justice; to condemn him to slavery and exile wasbarefaced tyranny.??I see, my fair cousin,? said Richard, ?you are of thosepretty ones who think an absent lover as bad as none, or as adead one. Be patient; half a score of light horsemen may yetfollow and redeem the error, if thy gallant have in keepingany secret which might render his death more convenientthan his banishment.??Peace with thy scurrile jests!? answered Edith, colouringdeeply. ?Think, rather, that for the indulgence of thy moodthou hast lopped from this great enterprise one goodly limb,deprived the Cross of one of its most brave supporters, andplaced a servant of the true God in the hands of the heathen;hast given, too, to minds as suspicious as thou hast shownthine own in this matter, some right to say that Richard Coeurde Lion banished the bravest soldier in his camp lest his namein battle might match his own.??I?I!? exclaimed Richard, now indeed greatly moved??am I one to be jealous of renown? I would he were here toprofess such an equality! I would waive my rank and mycrown, and meet him, manlike, in the lists, that it might 227Sir Walter Scottappear whether Richard Plantagenet had room to fear or toenvy the prowess of mortal man. Come, Edith, thou think?stnot as thou sayest. Let not anger or grief for the absence ofthy lover make thee unjust to thy kinsman, who, notwith-standing all thy techiness, values thy good report as high asthat of any one living.??The absence of my lover?? said the Lady Edith, ?But yes,he may be well termed my lover, who hath paid so dear forthe title. Unworthy as I might be of such homage, I was tohim like a light, leading him forward in the noble path ofchivalry; but that I forgot my rank, or that he presumedbeyond his, is false, were a king to speak it.??My fair cousin,? said Richard, ?do not put words in mymouth which I have not spoken. I said not you had gracedthis man beyond the favour which a good knight may earn,even from a princess, whatever be his native condition. But,by Our Lady, I know something of this love-gear. It beginswith mute respect and distant reverence; but when opportu-nities occur, familiarity increases, and so?But it skills nottalking with one who thinks herself wiser than all the world.??My kinsman?s counsels I willingly listen to, when they aresuch,? said Edith, ?as convey no insult to my rank and char-acter.??Kings, my fair cousin, do not counsel, but rather com-mand,? said Richard.?Soldans do indeed command,? said Edith, ?but it is be-cause they have slaves to govern.??Come, you might learn to lay aside this scorn of Soldanrie,when you hold so high of a Scot,? said the King. ?I holdSaladin to be truer to his word than this William of Scot-land, who must needs be called a Lion, forsooth; he hathfoully faulted towards me in failing to send the auxiliary aidhe promised. Let me tell thee, Edith, thou mayest live toprefer a true Turk to a false Scot.??No?never!? answered Edith??not should Richard him-self embrace the false religion, which he crossed the seas toexpel from Palestine.??Thou wilt have the last word,? said Richard, ?and thoushalt have it. Even think of me what thou wilt, pretty Edith.I shall not forget that we are near and dear cousins.?So saying, he took his leave in fair fashion, but very littlesatisfied with the result of his visit. 228The TalismanIt was the fourth day after Sir Kenneth had been dismissedfrom the camp, and King Richard sat in his pavilion, enjoy-ing an evening breeze from the west, which, with unusualcoolness on her wings, seemed breathed from merry Englandfor the refreshment of her adventurous Monarch, as he wasgradually recovering the full strength which was necessary tocarry on his gigantic projects. There was no one with him,De Vaux having been sent to Ascalon to bring up reinforce-ments and supplies of military munition, and most of hisother attendants being occupied in different departments,all preparing for the re-opening of hostilities, and for a grandpreparatory review of the army of the Crusaders, which wasto take place the next day. The King sat listening to the busyhum among the soldiery, the clatter from the forges, wherehorseshoes were preparing, and from the tents of thearmourers, who were repairing harness. The voice of the sol-diers, too, as they passed and repassed, was loud and cheer-ful, carrying with its very tone an assurance of high and ex-cited courage, and an omen of approaching victory. WhileRichard?s ear drank in these sounds with delight, and whilehe yielded himself to the visions of conquest and of glorywhich they suggested, an equerry told him that a messengerfrom Saladin waited without.?Admit him instantly,? said the King, ?and with duehonour, Josceline.?The English knight accordingly introduced a person, ap-parently of no higher rank than a Nubian slave, whose ap-pearance was nevertheless highly interesting. He was of su-perb stature and nobly formed, and his commanding fea-tures, although almost jet-black, showed nothing of negrodescent. He wore over his coal-black locks a milk-white tur-ban, and over his shoulders a short mantle of the same colour,open in front and at the sleeves, under which appeared adoublet of dressed leopard?s skin reaching within a hand-breadth of the knee. The rest of his muscular limbs, bothlegs and arms, were bare, excepting that he had sandals onhis feet, and wore a collar and bracelets of silver. A straightbroadsword, with a handle of box-wood and a sheath cov-ered with snakeskin, was suspended from his waist. In hisright hand he held a short javelin, with a broad, bright steelhead, of a span in length, and in his left he led by a leash oftwisted silk and gold a large and noble staghound. 229Sir Walter ScottThe messenger prostrated himself, at the same time par-tially uncovering his shoulders, in sign of humiliation, andhaving touched the earth with his forehead, arose so far as torest on one knee, while he delivered to the King a silkennapkin, enclosing another of cloth of gold, within whichwas a letter from Saladin in the original Arabic, with a trans-lation into Norman-English, which may be modernizedthus:??Saladin, King of Kings, to Melech Ric, the Lion of En-gland. Whereas, we are informed by thy last message thatthou hast chosen war rather than peace, and our enmity ratherthan our friendship, we account thee as one blinded in thismatter, and trust shortly to convince thee of thine error, bythe help of our invincible forces of the thousand tribes, whenMohammed, the Prophet of God, and Allah, the God of theProphet, shall judge the controversy betwixt us. In what re-mains, we make noble account of thee, and of the gifts whichthou hast sent us, and of the two dwarfs, singular in theirdeformity as Ysop, and mirthful as the lute of Isaack. And inrequital of these tokens from the treasure-house of thy bounty,behold we have sent thee a Nubian slave, named Zohauk, ofwhom judge not by his complexion, according to the foolishones of the earth, in respect the dark-rinded fruit hath themost exquisite flavour. Know that he is strong to execute thewill of his master, as Rustan of Zablestan; also he is wise togive counsel when thou shalt learn to hold communicationwith him, for the Lord of Speech hath been stricken withsilence betwixt the ivory walls of his palace. We commendhim to thy care, hoping the hour may not be distant whenhe may render thee good service. And herewith we bid theefarewell; trusting that our most holy Prophet may yet callthee to a sight of the truth, failing which illumination, ourdesire is for the speedy restoration of thy royal health, thatAllah may judge between thee and us in a plain field of battle.?And the missive was sanctioned by the signature and sealof the Soldan.Richard surveyed the Nubian in silence as he stood beforehim, his looks bent upon the ground, his arms folded on hisbosom, with the appearance of a black marble statue of themost exquisite workmanship, waiting life from the touch ofa Prometheus. The King of England, who, as it was emphati-cally said of his successor Henry the Eighth, loved to look 230The Talismanupon a man, was well pleased with the thews, sinews, andsymmetry of him whom he now surveyed, and questionedhim in the lingua franca, ?Art thou a pagan??The slave shook his head, and raising his finger to his brow,crossed himself in token of his Christianity, then resumedhis posture of motionless humility.?A Nubian Christian, doubtless,? said Richard, ?and mu-tilated of the organ of speech by these heathen dogs??The mute again slowly shook his head, in token of nega-tive, pointed with his forefinger to Heaven, and then laid itupon his own lips.?I understand thee,? said Richard; ?thou dost suffer underthe infliction of God, not by the cruelty of man. Canst thouclean an armour and belt, and buckle it in time of need??The mute nodded, and stepping towards the coat of mail,which hung with the shield and helmet of the chivalrousmonarch upon the pillar of the tent, he handled it with suchnicety of address as sufficiently to show that he fully under-stood the business of an armour-bearer.?Thou art an apt, and wilt doubtless be a useful knave.Thou shalt wait in my chamber, and on my person,? saidthe King, ?to show how much I value the gift of the royalSoldan. If thou hast no tongue, it follows thou canst carryno tales, neither provoke me to be sudden by any unfit re-ply.?The Nubian again prostrated himself till his brow touchedthe earth, then stood erect, at some paces distant, as waitingfor his new master?s commands.?Nay, thou shalt commence thy office presently,? said Ri-chard, ?for I see a speck of rust darkening on that shield; andwhen I shake it in the face of Saladin, it should be bright andunsullied as the Soldan?s honour and mine own.?A horn was winded without, and presently Sir HenryNeville entered with a packet of dispatches. ?From England,my lord,? he said, as he delivered it.?From England?our own England!? repeated Richard, ina tone of melancholy enthusiasm. ?Alas! they little think howhard their Sovereign has been beset by sickness and sorrow?faint friends and forward enemies.? Then opening the dis-patches, he said hastily, ?Ha! this comes from no peacefulland?they too have their feuds. Neville, begone; I mustperuse these tidings alone, and at leisure.? 231Sir Walter ScottNeville withdrew accordingly, and Richard was soon ab-sorbed in the melancholy details which had been conveyedto him from England, concerning the factions that were tear-ing to pieces his native dominions?the disunion of his broth-ers John and Geoffrey, and the quarrels of both with theHigh Justiciary Longchamp, Bishop of Ely?the oppressionspractised by the nobles upon the peasantry, and rebellion ofthe latter against their masters, which had produced every-where scenes of discord, and in some instances the effusionof blood. Details of incidents mortifying to his pride, andderogatory from his authority, were intermingled with theearnest advice of his wisest and most attached counsellorsthat he should presently return to England, as his presenceoffered the only hope of saving the Kingdom from all thehorrors of civil discord, of which France and Scotland werelikely to avail themselves. Filled with the most painful anxi-ety, Richard read, and again read, the ill-omened letters; com-pared the intelligence which some of them contained withthe same facts as differently stated in others; and soon be-came totally insensible to whatever was passing around him,although seated, for the sake of coolness, close to the en-trance of his tent, and having the curtains withdrawn, sothat he could see and be seen by the guards and others whowere stationed without.Deeper in the shadow of the pavilion, and busied with thetask his new master had imposed, sat the Nubian slave, withhis back rather turned towards the King. He had finishedadjusting and cleaning the hauberk and brigandine, and wasnow busily employed on a broad pavesse, or buckler, of un-usual size, and covered with steel-plating, which Richard oftenused in reconnoitring, or actually storming fortified places,as a more effectual protection against missile weapons thanthe narrow triangular shield used on horseback. This pavessebore neither the royal lions of England, nor any other de-vice, to attract the observation of the defenders of the wallsagainst which it was advanced; the care, therefore, of thearmourer was addressed to causing its surface to shine asbright as crystal, in which he seemed to be peculiarly suc-cessful. Beyond the Nubian, and scarce visible from with-out, lay the large dog, which might be termed his brotherslave, and which, as if he felt awed by being transferred to aroyal owner, was couched close to the side of the mute, with 232The Talismanhead and ears on the ground, and his limbs and tail drawnclose around and under him.While the Monarch and his new attendant were thus oc-cupied, another actor crept upon the scene, and mingledamong the group of English yeomen, about a score of whom,respecting the unusually pensive posture and close occupa-tion of their Sovereign, were, contrary to their wont, keep-ing a silent guard in front of his tent. It was not, however,more vigilant than usual. Some were playing at games ofhazard with small pebbles, others spoke together in whispersof the approaching day of battle, and several lay asleep, theirbulky limbs folded in their green mantles.Amid these careless warders glided the puny form of a littleold Turk, poorly dressed like a marabout or santon of thedesert?a sort of enthusiasts, who sometimes ventured intothe camp of the Crusaders, though treated always with con-tumely, and often with violence. Indeed, the luxury and prof-ligate indulgence of the Christian leaders had occasioned amotley concourse in their tents of musicians, courtesans, Jew-ish merchants, Copts, Turks, and all the varied refuse of theEastern nations; so that the caftan and turban, though todrive both from the Holy Land was the professed object ofthe expedition, were, nevertheless, neither an uncommonnor an alarming sight in the camp of the Crusaders. When,however, the little insignificant figure we have described ap-proached so nigh as to receive some interruption from thewarders, he dashed his dusky green turban from his head,showed that his beard and eyebrows were shaved like thoseof a professed buffoon, and that the expression of his fantas-tic and writhen features, as well as of his little black eyes,which glittered like jet, was that of a crazed imagination.?Dance, marabout,? cried the soldiers, acquainted with themanners of these wandering enthusiasts, ?dance, or we willscourge thee with our bow-strings till thou spin as never topdid under schoolboy?s lash.? Thus shouted the reckless ward-ers, as much delighted at having a subject to tease as a childwhen he catches a butterfly, or a schoolboy upon discover-ing a bird?s nest.The marabout, as if happy to do their behests, boundedfrom the earth, and spun his giddy round before them withsingular agility, which, when contrasted with his slight andwasted figure, and diminutive appearance, made him re- 233Sir Walter Scottsemble a withered leaf twirled round and round at the plea-sure of the winter?s breeze. His single lock of hair streamedupwards from his bald and shaven head, as if some genieupheld him by it; and indeed it seemed as if supernatural artwere necessary to the execution of the wild, whirling dance,in which scarce the tiptoe of the performer was seen to touchthe ground. Amid the vagaries of his performance he flewhere and there, from one spot to another, still approaching,however, though almost imperceptibly, to the entrance ofthe royal tent; so that, when at length he sunk exhausted onthe earth, after two or three bounds still higher than thosewhich he had yet executed, he was not above thirty yardsfrom the King?s person.?Give him water,? said one yeoman; ?they always crave adrink after their merry-go-round.??Aha, water, sayest thou, Long Allen?? exclaimed anotherarcher, with a most scornful emphasis on the despised ele-ment; ?how wouldst like such beverage thyself, after such amorrice dancing???The devil a water-drop he gets here,? said a third. ?Wewill teach the light-footed old infidel to be a good Christian,and drink wine of Cyprus.??Ay, ay,? said a fourth; ?and in case he be restive, fetchthou Dick Hunter?s horn, that he drenches his mare withal.?A circle was instantly formed around the prostrate andexhausted dervise, and while one tall yeoman raised his feebleform from the ground, another presented to him a hugeflagon of wine. Incapable of speech, the old man shook hishead, and waved away from him with his hand the liquorforbidden by the Prophet. But his tormentors were not thusto be appeased.?The horn, the horn!? exclaimed one. ?Little differencebetween a Turk and a Turkish horse, and we will use himconforming.??By Saint George, you will choke him!? said Long Allen; ?andbesides, it is a sin to throw away upon a heathen dog as muchwine as would serve a good Christian for a treble night-cap.??Thou knowest not the nature of these Turks and pagans,Long Allen,? replied Henry Woodstall. ?I tell thee, man, thatthis flagon of Cyprus will set his brains a-spinning, just inthe opposite direction that they went whirling in the danc-ing, and so bring him, as it were, to himself again. Choke? 234The TalismanHe will no more choke on it than Ben?s black bitch on thepound of butter.??And for grudging it,? said Tomalin Blacklees, ?whyshouldst thou grudge the poor paynim devil a drop of drinkon earth, since thou knowest he is not to have a drop to coolthe tip of his tongue through a long eternity???That were hard laws, look ye,? said Long Allen, ?only forbeing a Turk, as his father was before him. Had he beenChristian turned heathen, I grant you the hottest corner hadbeen good winter quarters for him.??Hold thy peace, Long Allen,? said Henry Woodstall. ?I tellthee that tongue of thine is not the shortest limb about thee,and I prophesy that it will bring thee into disgrace with FatherFrancis, as once about the black-eyed Syrian wench. But herecomes the horn. Be active a bit, man, wilt thou, and just forceopen his teeth with the haft of thy dudgeon-dagger.??Hold, hold?he is conformable,? said Tomalin; ?see, see,he signs for the goblet?give him room, boys! Oop sey es,quoth the Dutchman?down it goes like lamb?s-wool! Nay,they are true topers when once they begin?your Turk nevercoughs in his cup, or stints in his liquoring.?In fact, the dervise, or whatever he was, drank?or at leastseemed to drink?the large flagon to the very bottom at asingle pull; and when he took it from his lips after the wholecontents were exhausted, only uttered, with a deep sigh, thewords, Allah kerim, or God is merciful. There was a laughamong the yeomen who witnessed this pottle-deep potation,so obstreperous as to rouse and disturb the King, who, rais-ing his finger, said angrily, ?How, knaves, no respect, noobservance??All were at once hushed into silence, well acquainted withthe temper of Richard, which at some times admitted of muchmilitary familiarity, and at others exacted the most precise re-spect, although the latter humour was of much more rare oc-currence. Hastening to a more reverent distance from the royalperson, they attempted to drag along with them the marabout,who, exhausted apparently by previous fatigue, or overpow-ered by the potent draught he had just swallowed, resistedbeing moved from the spot, both with struggles and groans.?Leave him still, ye fools,? whispered Long Allen to hismates; ?by Saint Christopher, you will make our Dickon gobeside himself, and we shall have his dagger presently fly at 235Sir Walter Scottour costards. Leave him alone; in less than a minute he willsleep like a dormouse.?At the same moment the Monarch darted another impa-tient glance to the spot, and all retreated in haste, leaving thedervise on the ground, unable, as it seemed, to stir a singlelimb or joint of his body. In a moment afterward all was asstill and quiet as it had been before the intrusion.CHAPTER XXI.?and wither?d Murder,Alarum?d by his sentinel, the wolf,Whose howl?s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,With Tarquin?s ravishing strides, towards his designMoves like a ghost.Macbeth.FOR THE SPACE of a quarter of an hour, or longer, after theincident related, all remained perfectly quiet in the front ofthe royal habitation. The King read and mused in the en-trance of his pavilion; behind, and with his back turned tothe same entrance, the Nubian slave still burnished the amplepavesse; in front of all, at a hundred paces distant, the yeo-men of the guard stood, sat, or lay extended on the grass,attentive to their own sports, but pursuing them in silence,while on the esplanade betwixt them and the front of thetent lay, scarcely to be distinguished from a bundle of rags,the senseless form of the marabout. 236The TalismanBut the Nubian had the advantage of a mirror from thebrilliant reflection which the surface of the highly-polishedshield now afforded, by means of which he beheld, to hisalarm and surprise, that the marabout raised his head gentlyfrom the ground, so as to survey all around him, movingwith a well-adjusted precaution which seemed entirely in-consistent with a state of ebriety. He couched his head in-stantly, as if satisfied he was unobserved, and began, withthe slightest possible appearance of voluntary effort, to draghimself, as if by chance, ever nearer and nearer to the King,but stopping and remaining fixed at intervals, like the spi-der, which, moving towards her object, collapses into appar-ent lifelessness when she thinks she is the subject of observa-tion. This species of movement appeared suspicious to theEthiopian, who, on his part, prepared himself, as quietly aspossible, to interfere, the instant that interference should seemto be necessary.The marabout, meanwhile, glided on gradually and im-perceptibly, serpent-like, or rather snail-like, till he was aboutten yards distant from Richard?s person, when, starting onhis feet, he sprung forward with the bound of a tiger, stoodat the King?s back in less than an instant, and brandishedaloft the cangiar, or poniard, which he had hidden in hissleeve. Not the presence of his whole army could have savedtheir heroic Monarch; but the motions of the Nubian hadbeen as well calculated as those of the enthusiast, and ere thelatter could strike, the former caught his uplifted arm. Turn-ing his fanatical wrath upon what thus unexpectedly inter-posed betwixt him and his object, the Charegite, for suchwas the seeming marabout, dealt the Nubian a blow withthe dagger, which, however, only grazed his arm, while thefar superior strength of the Ethiopian easily dashed him tothe ground. Aware of what had passed, Richard had nowarisen, and with little more of surprise, anger, or interest ofany kind in his countenance than an ordinary man wouldshow in brushing off and crushing an intrusive wasp, caughtup the stool on which he had been sitting, and exclaimingonly, ?Ha, dog!? dashed almost to pieces the skull of theassassin, who uttered twice, once in a loud, and once in abroken tone, the words Allah ackbar!?God is victorious?and expired at the King?s feet.?Ye are careful warders,? said Richard to his archers, in a 237Sir Walter Scotttone of scornful reproach, as, aroused by the bustle of whathad passed, in terror and tumult they now rushed into histent; ?watchful sentinels ye are, to leave me to do suchhangman?s work with my own hand. Be silent, all of you,and cease your senseless clamour!?saw ye never a dead Turkbefore? Here, cast that carrion out of the camp, strike thehead from the trunk, and stick it on a lance, taking care toturn the face to Mecca, that he may the easier tell the foulimpostor on whose inspiration he came hither how he hassped on his errand.?For thee, my swart and silent friend,?he added, turning to the Ethiopian??but how?s this? Thouart wounded?and with a poisoned weapon, I warrant me,for by force of stab so weak an animal as that could scarcehope to do more than raze the lion?s hide.?Suck the poisonfrom his wound one of you?the venom is harmless on thelips, though fatal when it mingles with the blood.?The yeomen looked on each other confusedly and withhesitation, the apprehension of so strange a danger prevail-ing with those who feared no other.?How now, sirrahs,? continued the King, ?are you dainty-lipped, or do you fear death, that you daily thus???Not the death of a man,? said Long Allen, to whom theKing looked as he spoke; ?but methinks I would not die likea poisoned rat for the sake of a black chattel there, that isbought and sold in a market like a Martlemas ox.??His Grace speaks to men of sucking poison,? mutteredanother yeoman, ?as if he said, ?Go to, swallow a goose-berry!??Nay,? said Richard, ?I never bade man do that which Iwould not do myself.?And without further ceremony, and in spite of the generalexpostulations of those around, and the respectful opposi-tion of the Nubian himself, the King of England applied hislips to the wound of the black slave, treating with ridicule allremonstrances, and overpowering all resistance. He had nosooner intermitted his singular occupation, than the Nubianstarted from him, and casting a scarf over his arm, intimatedby gestures, as firm in purpose as they were respectful inmanner, his determination not to permit the Monarch torenew so degrading an employment. Long Allen also inter-posed, saying that, if it were necessary to prevent the Kingengaging again in a treatment of this kind, his own lips, 238The Talismantongue, and teeth were at the service of the negro (as hecalled the Ethiopian), and that he would eat him up bodily,rather than King Richard?s mouth should again approachhim.Neville, who entered with other officers, added his remon-strances.?Nay, nay, make not a needless halloo about a hart that thehounds have lost, or a danger when it is over,? said the King.?The wound will be a trifle, for the blood is scarce drawn?an angry cat had dealt a deeper scratch. And for me, I havebut to take a drachm of orvietan by way of precaution, thoughit is needless.? Thus spoke Richard, a little ashamed, perhaps, of his owncondescension, though sanctioned both by humanity andgratitude. But when Neville continued to make remon-strances on the peril to his royal person, the King imposedsilence on him.?Peace, I prithee?make no more of it. I did it but to showthese ignorant, prejudiced knaves how they might help eachother when these cowardly caitiffs come against us withsarbacanes and poisoned shafts. But,? he added, ?take theethis Nubian to thy quarters, Neville?I have changed mymind touching him?let him be well cared for. But hark inthine ear; see that he escapes thee not?there is more in himthan seems. Let him have all liberty, so that he leave not thecamp.?And you, ye beef-devouring, wine-swilling Englishmastiffs, get ye to your guard again, and be sure you keep itmore warily. Think not you are now in your own land of fairplay, where men speak before they strike, and shake handsere they cut throats. Danger in our land walks openly, andwith his blade drawn, and defies the foe whom he means toassault; but here he challenges you with a silk glove insteadof a steel gauntlet, cuts your throat with the feather of aturtle-dove, stabs you with the tongue of a priest?s brooch,or throttles you with the lace of my lady?s boddice, Go to?keep your eyes open and your mouths shut?drink less, andlook sharper about you; or I will place your huge stomachson such short allowance as would pinch the stomach of apatient Scottish man.?The yeomen, abashed and mortified, withdrew to theirpost, and Neville was beginning to remonstrate with hismaster upon the risk of passing over thus slightly their neg- 239Sir Walter Scottligence upon their duty, and the propriety of an example in acase so peculiarly aggravated as the permitting one so suspi-cious as the marabout to approach within dagger?s length ofhis person, when Richard interrupted him with, ?Speak notof it, Neville?wouldst thou have me avenge a petty risk tomyself more severely than the loss of England?s banner? Ithas been stolen?stolen by a thief, or delivered up by a trai-tor, and no blood has been shed for it.?My sable friend,thou art an expounder of mysteries, saith the illustriousSoldan?now would I give thee thine own weight in gold,if, by raising one still blacker than thyself or by what othermeans thou wilt, thou couldst show me the thief who didmine honour that wrong. What sayest thou, ha??The mute seemed desirous to speak, but uttered only thatimperfect sound proper to his melancholy condition; thenfolded his arms, looked on the King with an eye of intelli-gence, and nodded in answer to his question.?How!? said Richard, with joyful impatience. ?Wilt thouundertake to make discovery in this matter??The Nubian slave repeated the same motion.?But how shall we understand each other?? said the King.?Canst thou write, good fellow??The slave again nodded in assent.?Give him writing-tools,? said the King. ?They were readierin my father?s tent than mine; but they be somewhere about,if this scorching climate have not dried up the ink.?Why,this fellow is a jewel?a black diamond, Neville.??So please you, my liege,? said Neville, ?if I might speakmy poor mind, it were ill dealing in this ware. This manmust be a wizard, and wizards deal with the Enemy, whohath most interest to sow tares among the wheat, and bringdissension into our councils, and???Peace, Neville,? said Richard. ?Hello to your northernhound when he is close on the haunch of the deer, and hopeto recall him, but seek not to stop Plantagenet when he hathhope to retrieve his honour.?The slave, who during this discussion had been writing, inwhich art he seemed skilful, now arose, and pressing what hehad written to his brow, prostrated himself as usual, ere hedelivered it into the King?s hands. The scroll was in French,although their intercourse had hitherto been conducted byRichard in the lingua franca. 240The Talisman?To Richard, the conquering and invincible King of En-gland, this from the humblest of his slaves. Mysteries are thesealed caskets of Heaven, but wisdom may devise means toopen the lock. Were your slave stationed where the leaders ofthe Christian host were made to pass before him in order,doubt nothing that if he who did the injury whereof my Kingcomplains shall be among the number, he may be made mani-fest in his iniquity, though it be hidden under seven veils.??Now, by Saint George!? said King Richard, ?thou hastspoken most opportunely.?Neville, thou knowest that whenwe muster our troops to-morrow the princes have agreedthat, to expiate the affront offered to England in the theft ofher banner, the leaders should pass our new standard as itfloats on Saint George?s Mount, and salute it with formalregard. Believe me, the secret traitor will not dare to absenthimself from an expurgation so solemn, lest his very absenceshould be matter of suspicion. There will we place our sableman of counsel, and if his art can detect the villain, leave meto deal with him.??My liege,? said Neville, with the frankness of an Englishbaron, ?beware what work you begin. Here is the concord ofour holy league unexpectedly renewed?will you, upon suchsuspicion as a negro slave can instil, tear open wounds solately closed? Or will you use the solemn procession, adoptedfor the reparation of your honour and establishment of una-nimity amongst the discording princes, as the means of againfinding out new cause of offence, or reviving ancient quar-rels? It were scarce too strong to say this were a breach of thedeclaration your Grace made to the assembled Council ofthe Crusade.??Neville,? said the King, sternly interrupting him, ?thy zealmakes thee presumptuous and unmannerly. Never did Ipromise to abstain from taking whatever means were mostpromising to discover the infamous author of the attack onmy honour. Ere I had done so, I would have renounced mykingdom, my life. All my declarations were under this nec-essary and absolute qualification;?only, if Austria hadstepped forth and owned the injury like a man, I proffered,for the sake of Christendom, to have forgiven him.??But,? continued the baron anxiously, ?what hope that thisjuggling slave of Saladin will not palter with your Grace???Peace, Neville,? said the King; ?thou thinkest thyself 241Sir Walter Scottmighty wise, and art but a fool. Mind thou my charge touch-ing this fellow; there is more in him than thy Westmorelandwit can fathom.?And thou, smart and silent, prepare toperform the feat thou hast promised, and, by the word of aKing, thou shalt choose thine own recompense.?Lo, hewrites again.?The mute accordingly wrote and delivered to the King,with the same form as before, another slip of paper, contain-ing these words, ?The will of the King is the law to his slave;nor doth it become him to ask guerdon for discharge of hisdevoir.??Guerdon and Devoir!? said the King, interrupting him selfas he read, and speaking to Neville in the English tonguewith some emphasis on the words. ?These Eastern peoplewill profit by the Crusaders?they are acquiring the languageof chivalry! And see, Neville, how discomposed that fellowlooks! were it not for his colour he would blush. I should notthink it strange if he understood what I say?they are peril-ous linguists.??The poor slave cannot endure your Grace?s eye,? saidNeville; ?it is nothing more.??Well, but,? continued the King, striking the paper withhis finger as he proceeded, ?this bold scroll proceeds to saythat our trusty mute is charged with a message from Saladinto the Lady Edith Plantagenet, and craves means and oppor-tunity to deliver it. What thinkest thou of a request so mod-est?ha, Neville???I cannot say,? said Neville, ?how such freedom may relishwith your Grace; but the lease of the messenger?s neck wouldbe a short one, who should carry such a request to the Soldanon the part of your Majesty.??Nay, I thank Heaven that I covet none of his sunburntbeauties,? said Richard; ?and for punishing this fellow fordischarging his master?s errand, and that when he has justsaved my life?methinks it were something too summary.I?ll tell thee, Neville, a secret; for although our sable andmute minister be present, he cannot, thou knowest, tell itover again, even if he should chance to understand us. I tellthee that, for this fortnight past, I have been under a strangespell, and I would I were disenchanted. There has no soonerany one done me good service, but, lo you, he cancels hisinterest in me by some deep injury; and, on the other hand, 242The Talismanhe who hath deserved death at my hands for some treacheryor some insult, is sure to be the very person of all others whoconfers upon me some obligation that overbalances his de-merits, and renders respite of his sentence a debt due frommy honour. Thus, thou seest, I am deprived of the best partof my royal function, since I can neither punish men norreward them. Until the influence of this disqualifying planetbe passed away, I will say nothing concerning the request ofthis our sable attendant, save that it is an unusually boldone, and that his best chance of finding grace in our eyes willbe to endeavour to make the discovery which he proposes toachieve in our behalf. Meanwhile, Neville, do thou look wellto him, and let him be honourably cared for. And hark theeonce more,? he said, in a low whisper, ?seek out yonder her-mit of Engaddi, and bring him to me forthwith, be he saintor savage, madman or sane. Let me see him privately.?Neville retired from the royal tent, signing to the Nubianto follow him, and much surprised at what he had seen andheard, and especially at the unusual demeanour of the King.In general, no task was so easy as to discover Richard?s im-mediate course of sentiment and feeling, though it might, insome cases, be difficult to calculate its duration; for no weath-ercock obeyed the changing wind more readily than the Kinghis gusts of passion. But on the present occasion his mannerseemed unusually constrained and mysterious; nor was it easyto guess whether displeasure or kindness predominated inhis conduct towards his new dependant, or in the looks withwhich, from time to time, he regarded him. The ready ser-vice which the King had rendered to counteract the bad ef-fects of the Nubian?s wound might seem to balance the obli-gation conferred on him by the slave when he interceptedthe blow of the assassin; but it seemed, as a much longeraccount remained to be arranged between them, that theMonarch was doubtful whether the settlement might leavehim, upon the whole, debtor or creditor, and that, therefore,he assumed in the meantime a neutral demeanour, whichmight suit with either character. As for the Nubian, by what-ever means he had acquired the art of writing the Europeanlanguages, the King remained convinced that the Englishtongue at least was unknown to him, since, having watchedhim closely during the last part of the interview, he con-ceived it impossible for any one understanding a conversa- 243Sir Walter Scotttion, of which he was himself the subject, to have so com-pletely avoided the appearance of taking an interest in it.CHAPTER XXII.Who?s there!?Approach??tis kindly done?My learned physician and a friend.Sir Eustace Grey.OUR NARRATIVE RETROGRADES to a period shortly previous tothe incidents last mentioned, when, as the reader must re-member, the unfortunate Knight of the Leopard, bestowedupon the Arabian physician by King Richard, rather as aslave than in any other capacity, was exiled from the camp ofthe Crusaders, in whose ranks he had so often and so bril-liantly distinguished himself. He followed his new master?for so he must now term the Hakim?to the Moorish tentswhich contained his retinue and his property, with the stu-pefied feelings of one who, fallen from the summit of a preci-pice, and escaping unexpectedly with life, is just able to draghimself from the fatal spot, but without the power of esti-mating the extent of the damage which he has sustained.Arrived at the tent, he threw himself, without speech of any 244The Talismankind, upon a couch of dressed buffalo?s hide, which waspointed out to him by his conductor, and hiding his facebetwixt his hands, groaned heavily, as if his heart were onthe point of bursting. The physician heard him, as he wasgiving orders to his numerous domestics to prepare for theirdeparture the next morning before daybreak, and, movedwith compassion, interrupted his occupation to sit down,cross-legged, by the side of his couch, and administer com-fort according to the Oriental manner.?My friend,? he said, ?be of good comfort; for what saiththe poet?it is better that a man should be the servant of akind master than the slave of his own wild passions. Again,be of good courage; because, whereas Ysouf Ben Yagoubewas sold to a king by his brethren, even to Pharaoh, King ofEgypt, thy king hath, on the other hand, bestowed thee onone who will be to thee as a brother.?Sir Kenneth made an effort to thank the Hakim, but hisheart was too full, and the indistinct sounds which accom-panied his abortive attempts to reply induced the kind phy-sician to desist from his premature endeavours at consola-tion. He left his new domestic, or guest, in quiet, to indulgehis sorrows, and having commanded all the necessary prepa-rations for their departure on the morning, sat down uponthe carpet of the tent, and indulged himself in a moderaterepast. After he had thus refreshed himself, similar viandswere offered to the Scottish knight; but though the slaves lethim understand that the next day would be far advanced erethey would halt for the purpose of refreshment, Sir Kennethcould not overcome the disgust which he felt against swal-lowing any nourishment, and could be prevailed upon totaste nothing, saving a draught of cold water.He was awake long after his Arab host had performed hisusual devotions and betaken himself to his repose; nor hadsleep visited him at the hour of midnight, when a movementtook place among the domestics, which, though attendedwith no speech, and very little noise, made him aware theywere loading the camels and preparing for departure. In thecourse of these preparations, the last person who was dis-turbed, excepting the physician himself, was the knight ofScotland, whom, about three in the morning, a sort of ma-jor-domo, or master of the household, acquainted that hemust arise. He did so, without further answer, and followed 245Sir Walter Scotthim into the moonlight, where stood the camels, most ofwhich were already loaded, and one only remained kneelinguntil its burden should be completed.A little apart from the camels stood a number of horsesready bridled and saddled, and the Hakim himself, comingforth, mounted on one of them with as much agility as thegrave decorum of his character permitted, and directed an-other, which he pointed out, to be led towards Sir Kenneth.An English officer was in attendance, to escort them throughthe camp of the Crusaders, and to ensure their leaving it insafety; and all was ready for their departure. The pavilionwhich they had left was, in the meanwhile, struck with sin-gular dispatch, and the tent-poles and coverings composedthe burden of the last camel?when the physician, pronounc-ing solemnly the verse of the Koran, ?God be our guide, andMohammed our protector, in the desert as in the wateredfield,? the whole cavalcade was instantly in motion.In traversing the camp, they were challenged by the vari-ous sentinels who maintained guard there, and suffered toproceed in silence, or with a muttered curse upon theirprophet, as they passed the post of some more zealous Cru-sader. At length the last barriers were left behind them, andthe party formed themselves for the march with military pre-caution. Two or three horsemen advanced in front as a van-guard; one or two remained a bow-shot in the rear; and,wherever the ground admitted, others were detached to keepan outlook on the flanks. In this manner they proceededonward; while Sir Kenneth, looking back on the moonlitcamp, might now indeed seem banished, deprived at once ofhonour and of liberty, from the glimmering banners underwhich he had hoped to gain additional renown, and thetented dwellings of chivalry, of Christianity, and?of EdithPlantagenet.The Hakim, who rode by his side, observed, in his usualtone: of sententious consolation, ?It is unwise to look backwhen the journey lieth forward;? and as he spoke, the horseof the knight made such a perilous stumble as threatened toadd a practical moral to the tale.The knight was compelled by this hint to give more atten-tion to the management of his steed, which more than oncerequired the assistance and support of the check-bridle, al-though, in other respects, nothing could be more easy at 246The Talismanonce, and active, than the ambling pace at which the animal(which was a mare) proceeded.?The conditions of that horse,? observed the sententiousphysician, ?are like those of human fortune?seeing that,amidst his most swift and easy pace, the rider must guardhimself against a fall, and that it is when prosperity is at thehighest that our prudence should be awake and vigilant toprevent misfortune.?The overloaded appetite loathes even the honeycomb, andit is scarce a wonder that the knight, mortified and harassedwith misfortunes and abasement, became something impa-tient of hearing his misery made, at every turn, the groundof proverbs and apothegms, however just and apposite.?Methinks,? he said, rather peevishly, ?I wanted no addi-tional illustration of the instability of fortune though I wouldthank thee, Sir Hakim, for the choice of a steed for me, wouldthe jade but stumble so effectually as at once to break myneck and her own.??My brother,? answered the Arab sage, with imperturb-able gravity, ?thou speakest as one of the foolish. Thou sayestin thy heart that the sage should have given you, as his guest,the younger and better horse, and reserved the old one forhimself. But know that the defects of the older steed may becompensated by the energies of the young rider, whereas theviolence of the young horse requires to be moderated by thecold temper of the older.?So spoke the sage; but neither to this observation did SirKenneth return any answer which could lead to a continu-ance of their conversation, and the physician, wearied, per-haps, of administering comfort to one who would not becomforted, signed to one of his retinue.?Hassan,? he said, ?hast thou nothing wherewith to be-guile the way??Hassan, story-teller and poet by profession, spurred up,upon this summons, to exercise his calling. ?Lord of the pal-ace of life,? he said, addressing the physician, ?thou, beforewhom the angel Azrael spreadeth his wings for flight?thou,wiser than Solimaun Ben Daoud, upon whose signet wasinscribed the real name which controls the spirits of the ele-ments?forbid it, Heaven, that while thou travellest uponthe track of benevolence, bearing healing and hope wher-ever thou comest, thine own course should be saddened for 247Sir Walter Scottlack of the tale and of the song. Behold, while thy servant isat thy side, he will pour forth the treasures of his memory, asthe fountain sendeth her stream beside the pathway, for therefreshment or him that walketh thereon.?After this exordium, Hassan uplifted his voice, and begana tale of love and magic, intermixed with feats of warlikeachievement, and ornamented with abundant quotationsfrom the Persian poets, with whose compositions the oratorseemed familiar. The retinue of the physician, such exceptedas were necessarily detained in attendance on the camels,thronged up to the narrator, and pressed as close as defer-ence for their master permitted, to enjoy the delight whichthe inhabitants of the East have ever derived from this spe-cies of exhibition.At another time, notwithstanding his imperfect knowledgeof the language, Sir Kenneth might have been interested inthe recitation, which, though dictated by a more extrava-gant imagination, and expressed in more inflated and meta-phorical language, bore yet a strong resemblance to the ro-mances of chivalry then so fashionable in Europe. But asmatters stood with him, he was scarcely even sensible that aman in the centre of the cavalcade recited and sung, in a lowtone, for nearly two hours, modulating his voice to the vari-ous moods of passion introduced into the tale, and receiv-ing, in return, now low murmurs of applause, now mutteredexpressions of wonder, now sighs and tears, and sometimes,what it was far more difficult to extract from such an audi-ence, a tribute of smiles, and even laughter.During the recitation, the attention of the exile, howeverabstracted by his own deep sorrow, was occasionally awak-ened by the low wail of a dog, secured in a wicker enclosuresuspended on one of the camels, which, as an experiencedwoodsman, he had no hesitation in recognizing to be that ofhis own faithful hound; and from the plaintive tone of theanimal, he had no doubt that he was sensible of his master?svicinity, and, in his way, invoking his assistance for libertyand rescue.?Alas! poor Roswal,? he said, ?thou callest for aid and sym-pathy upon one in stricter bondage than thou thyself art. Iwill not seem to heed thee or return thy affection, since itwould serve but to load our parting with yet more bitter-ness.? 248The TalismanThus passed the hours of night and the space of dim hazydawn which forms the twilight of a Syrian morning. Butwhen the very first line of the sun?s disk began to rise abovethe level horizon, and when the very first level ray shot glim-mering in dew along the surface of the desert, which thetravellers had now attained, the sonorous voice of El Hakimhimself overpowered and cut short the narrative of the tale-teller, while he caused to resound along the sands the solemnsummons, which the muezzins thunder at morning from theminaret of every mosque.?To prayer?to prayer! God is the one God.?To prayer?to prayer! Mohammed is the Prophet of God.?To prayer?to prayer! Time is flying from you.?To prayer?to prayer!Judgment is drawing nigh to you,?In an instant each Moslem cast himself from his horse,turned his face towards Mecca, and performed with sand animitation of those ablutions, which were elsewhere requiredto be made with water, while each individual, in brief butfervent ejaculations, recommended himself to the care, andhis sins to the forgiveness, of God and the Prophet.Even Sir Kenneth, whose reason at once and prejudiceswere offended by seeing his companions in that which heconsidered as an act of idolatry, could not help respectingthe sincerity of their misguided zeal, and being stimulatedby their fervour to apply supplications to Heaven in a purerform, wondering, meanwhile, what new-born feelings couldteach him to accompany in prayer, though with varied invo-cation, those very Saracens, whose heathenish worship hehad conceived a crime dishonourable to the land in whichhigh miracles had been wrought, and where the day-star ofredemption had arisen.The act of devotion, however, though rendered in suchstrange society, burst purely from his natural feelings of reli-gious duty, and had its usual effect in composing the spiritswhich had been long harassed by so rapid a succession ofcalamities. The sincere and earnest approach of the Chris-tian to the throne of the Almighty teaches the best lesson ofpatience under affliction; since wherefore should we mockthe Deity with supplications, when we insult him by mur-muring under His decrees? or how, while our prayers have inevery word admitted the vanity and nothingness of the thingsof time in comparison to those of eternity, should we hope 249Sir Walter Scottto deceive the Searcher of Hearts, by permitting the worldand worldly passions to reassume the reins even immedi-ately after a solemn address to Heaven! But Sir Kenneth wasnot of these. He felt himself comforted and strengthened,and better prepared to execute or submit to whatever hisdestiny might call upon him to do or to suffer.Meanwhile, the party of Saracens regained their saddles,and continued their route, and the tale-teller, Hassan, re-sumed the thread of his narrative; but it was no longer to thesame attentive audience. A horseman, who had ascendedsome high ground on the right hand of the little column,had returned on a speedy gallop to El Hakim, and commu-nicated with him. Four or five more cavaliers had then beendispatched, and the little band, which might consist of abouttwenty or thirty persons, began to follow them with theireyes, as men from whose gestures, and advance or retreat,they were to augur good or evil. Hassan, finding his audi-ence inattentive, or being himself attracted by the dubiousappearances on the flank, stinted in his song; and the marchbecame silent, save when a camel-driver called out to hispatient charge, or some anxious follower of the Hakim com-municated with his next neighbour in a hurried and lowwhisper.This suspense continued until they had rounded a ridge,composed of hillocks of sand, which concealed from theirmain body the object that had created this alarm among theirscouts. Sir Kenneth could now see, at the distance of a mileor more, a dark object moving rapidly on the bosom of thedesert, which his experienced eye recognized for a party ofcavalry, much superior to their own in numbers, and, fromthe thick and frequent flashes which flung back the levelbeams of the rising sun, it was plain that these were Europe-ans in their complete panoply.The anxious looks which the horsemen of El Hakim nowcast upon their leader seemed to indicate deep apprehen-sion; while he, with gravity as undisturbed as when he calledhis followers to prayer, detached two of his best-mountedcavaliers, with instructions to approach as closely as prudencepermitted to these travellers of the desert, and observe moreminutely their numbers, their character, and, if possible, theirpurpose. The approach of danger, or what was feared as such,was like a stimulating draught to one in apathy, and recalled 250The TalismanSir Kenneth to himself and his situation.?What fear you from these Christian horsemen, for suchthey seem?? he said to the Hakim.?Fear!? said El Hakim, repeating the word disdainfully.?The sage fears nothing but Heaven, but ever expects fromwicked men the worst which they can do.??They are Christians,? said Sir Kenneth, ?and it is the timeof truce?why should you fear a breach of faith???They are the priestly soldiers of the Temple,? answered ElHakim, ?whose vow limits them to know neither truce norfaith with the worshippers of Islam. May the Prophet blightthem, both root, branch, and twig! Their peace is war, andtheir faith is falsehood. Other invaders of Palestine have theirtimes and moods of courtesy. The lion Richard will sparewhen he has conquered, the eagle Philip will close his wingwhen he has stricken a prey, even the Austrian bear will sleepwhen he is gorged; but this horde of ever-hungry wolves knowneither pause nor satiety in their rapine. Seest thou not thatthey are detaching a party from their main body, and thatthey take an eastern direction? Yon are their pages and squires,whom they train up in their accursed mysteries, and whom,as lighter mounted, they send to cut us off from our water-ing-place. But they will be disappointed. I know the war ofthe desert yet better than they.?He spoke a few words to his principal officer, and his wholedemeanour and countenance was at once changed from thesolemn repose of an Eastern sage accustomed more to con-templation than to action, into the prompt and proud expres-sion of a gallant soldier whose energies are roused by the nearapproach of a danger which he at once foresees and despises.To Sir Kenneth?s eyes the approaching crisis had a differ-ent aspect, and when Adonbec said to him, ?Thou must tarryclose by my side,? he answered solemnly in the negative.?Yonder,? he said, ?are my comrades in arms?the men inwhose society I have vowed to fight or fall. On their bannergleams the sign of our most blessed redemption?I cannotfly from the Cross in company with the Crescent.??Fool!? said the Hakim; ?their first action would be to dothee to death, were it only to conceal their breach of thetruce.??Of that I must take my chance,? replied Sir Kenneth;?but I wear not the bonds of the infidels an instant longer 251Sir Walter Scottthan I can cast them from me.??Then will I compel thee to follow me,? said El Hakim.?Compel!? answered Sir Kenneth angrily. ?Wert thou notmy benefactor, or one who has showed will to be such, andwere it not that it is to thy confidence I owe the freedom ofthese hands, which thou mightst have loaded with fetters, Iwould show thee that, unarmed as I am, compulsion wouldbe no easy task.??Enough, enough,? replied the Arabian physician, ?we losetime even when it is becoming precious.?So saying, he threw his arm aloft, and uttered a loud andshrill cry, as a signal to his retinue, who instantly dispersedthemselves on the face of the desert, in as many differentdirections as a chaplet of beads when the string is broken. SirKenneth had no time to note what ensued; for, at the sameinstant, the Hakim seized the rein of his steed, and puttinghis own to its mettle, both sprung forth at once with thesuddenness of light, and at a pitch of velocity which almostdeprived the Scottish knight of the power of respiration, andleft him absolutely incapable, had he been desirous, to havechecked the career of his guide. Practised as Sir Kenneth wasin horsemanship from his earliest youth, the speediest horsehe had ever mounted was a tortoise in comparison to thoseof the Arabian sage. They spurned the sand from behindthem; they seemed to devour the desert before them; milesflew away with minutes?and yet their strength seemed un-abated, and their respiration as free as when they first startedupon the wonderful race. The motion, too, as easy as it wasswift, seemed more like flying through the air than riding onthe earth, and was attended with no unpleasant sensation,save the awe naturally felt by one who is moving at suchastonishing speed, and the difficulty of breathing occasionedby their passing through the air so rapidly.It was not until after an hour of this portentous motion,and when all human pursuit was far, far behind, that theHakim at length relaxed his speed, and, slackening the paceof the horses into a hand-gallop, began, in a voice as com-posed and even as if he had been walking for the last hour, adescant upon the excellence of his coursers to the Scot, who,breathless, half blind, half deaf, and altogether giddy; fromthe rapidity of this singular ride, hardly comprehended thewords which flowed so freely from his companion. 252The Talisman?These horses,? he said, ?are of the breed called the Winged,equal in speed to aught excepting the Borak of the Prophet.They are fed on the golden barley of Yemen, mixed withspices and with a small portion of dried sheep?s flesh. Kingshave given provinces to possess them, and their age is activeas their youth. Thou, Nazarene, art the first, save a true be-liever, that ever had beneath his loins one of this noble race,a gift of the Prophet himself to the blessed Ali, his kinsmanand lieutenant, well called the Lion of God. Time lays histouch so lightly on these generous steeds, that the mare onwhich thou now sittest has seen five times five years passover her, yet retains her pristine speed and vigour, only thatin the career the support of a bridle, managed by a handmore experienced than thine, hath now become necessary.May the Prophet be blessed, who hath bestowed on the truebelievers the means of advance and retreat, which causeththeir iron-clothed enemies to be worn out with their ownponderous weight! How the horses of yonder dog Templarsmust have snorted and blown, when they had toiled fetlock-deep in the desert for one-twentieth part of the space whichthese brave steeds have left behind them, without one thickpant, or a drop of moisture upon their sleek and velvet coats!?The Scottish knight, who had now begun to recover hisbreath and powers of attention, could not help acknowledg-ing in his heart the advantage possessed by these Easternwarriors in a race of animals, alike proper for advance orretreat, and so admirably adapted to the level and sandydeserts of Arabia and Syria. But he did not choose to aug-ment the pride of the Moslem by acquiescing in his proudclaim of superiority, and therefore suffered the conversationto drop, and, looking around him, could now, at the moremoderate pace at which they moved, distinguish that he wasin a country not unknown to him.The blighted borders and sullen waters of the Dead Sea,the ragged and precipitous chain of mountains arising onthe left, the two or three palms clustered together, formingthe single green speck on the bosom of the waste wilder-ness?objects which, once seen, were scarcely to be forgot-ten?showed to Sir Kenneth that they were approaching thefountain called the Diamond of the Desert, which had beenthe scene of his interview on a former occasion with theSaracen Emir Sheerkohf, or Ilderim. In a few minutes they 253Sir Walter Scottchecked their horses beside the spring, and the Hakim in-vited Sir Kenneth to descend from horseback and repose him-self as in a place of safety. They unbridled their steeds, ElHakim observing that further care of them was unnecessary,since they would be speedily joined by some of the bestmounted among his slaves, who would do what further wasneedful.?Meantime,? he said, spreading some food on the grass,?eat and drink, and be not discouraged. Fortune may raiseup or abase the ordinary mortal, but the sage and the soldiershould have minds beyond her control.?The Scottish knight endeavoured to testify his thanks byshowing himself docile; but though he strove to eat out ofcomplaisance, the singular contrast between his present situ-ation and that which he had occupied on the same spot whenthe envoy of princes and the victor in combat, came like acloud over his mind, and fasting, lassitude, and fatigue op-pressed his bodily powers. El Hakim examined his hurriedpulse, his red and inflamed eye, his heated hand, and hisshortened respiration.?The mind,? he said, ?grows wise by watching, but hersister the body, of coarser materials, needs the support ofrepose. Thou must sleep; and that thou mayest do so to re-freshment, thou must take a draught mingled with this elixir.?He drew from his bosom a small crystal vial, cased in silverfiligree-work, and dropped into a little golden drinking-cupa small portion of a dark-coloured fluid.?This,? he said, ?is one of those productions which Allahhath sent on earth for a blessing, though man?s weakness andwickedness have sometimes converted it into a curse. It ispowerful as the wine-cup of the Nazarene to drop the cur-tain on the sleepless eye, and to relieve the burden of theoverloaded bosom; but when applied to the purposes of in-dulgence and debauchery, it rends the nerves, destroys thestrength, weakens the intellect, and undermines life. But fearnot thou to use its virtues in the time of need, for the wiseman warms him by the same firebrand with which the mad-man burneth the tent.? [Some preparation of opium seemsto be intimated.]?I have seen too much of thy skill, sage Hakim,? said SirKenneth, ?to debate thine hest;? and swallowed the narcotic,mingled as it was with some water from the spring, then 254The Talismanwrapped him in the haik, or Arab cloak, which had beenfastened to his saddle-pommel, and, according to the direc-tions of the physician, stretched himself at ease in the shadeto await the promised repose. Sleep came not at first, but inher stead a train of pleasing yet not rousing or awakeningsensations. A state ensued in which, still conscious of hisown identity and his own condition, the knight felt enabledto consider them not only without alarm and sorrow, but ascomposedly as he might have viewed the story of his misfor-tunes acted upon a stage?or rather as a disembodied spiritmight regard the transactions of its past existence. From thisstate of repose, amounting almost to apathy respecting thepast, his thoughts were carried forward to the future, which,in spite of all that existed to overcloud the prospect, glitteredwith such hues as, under much happier auspices, hisunstimulated imagination had not been able to produce, evenin its most exalted state. Liberty, fame, successful love, ap-peared to be the certain and not very distant prospect of theenslaved exile, the dishonoured knight, even of the despair-ing lover who had placed his hopes of happiness so far be-yond the prospect of chance, in her wildest possibilities, serv-ing to countenance his wishes. Gradually as the intellectualsight became overclouded, these gay visions became obscure,like the dying hues of sunset, until they were at last lost intotal oblivion; and Sir Kenneth lay extended at the feet of ElHakim, to all appearance, but for his deep respiration, asinanimate a corpse as if life had actually departed. 255Sir Walter ScottCHAPTER XXIII.?Mid these wild scenes Enchantment waves her hand,To change the face of the mysterious land;Till the bewildering scenes around us seemThe Vain productions of a feverish dream.Astolpho, A Romance.When the Knight of the Leopard awoke from his long andprofound repose, he found himself in circumstances so dif-ferent from those in which he had lain down to sleep, thathe doubted whether he was not still dreaming, or whetherthe scene had not been changed by magic. Instead of thedamp grass, he lap on a couch of more than Oriental luxury;and some kind hands had, during his repose, stripped himof the cassock of chamois which he wore under his armour,and substituted a night-dress of the finest linen and a loosegown of silk. He had been canopied only by the palm-treesof the desert, but now he lay beneath a silken pavilion, whichblazed with the richest colours of the Chinese loom, while aslight curtain of gauze, displayed around his couch, was cal-culated to protect his repose from the insects, to which hehad, ever since his arrival in these climates, been a constantand passive prey. He looked around, as if to convince him-self that he was actually awake; and all that fell beneath hiseye partook of the splendour of his dormitory. A portablebath of cedar, lined with silver, was ready for use, and steamedwith the odours which had been used in preparing it. On asmall stand of ebony beside the couch stood a silver vase,containing sherbet of the most exquisite quality, cold as snow,and which the thirst that followed the use of the strong nar-cotic rendered peculiarly delicious. Still further to dispel thedregs of intoxication which it had left behind, the knightresolved to use the bath, and experienced in doing so a de-lightful refreshment. Having dried himself with napkins ofthe Indian wool, he would willingly have resumed his owncoarse garments, that he might go forth to see whether theworld was as much changed without as within the place ofhis repose. These, however, were nowhere to be seen, but intheir place he found a Saracen dress of rich materials, withsabre and poniard, and all befitting an emir of distinction. 256The TalismanHe was able to suggest no motive to himself for this exuber-ance of care, excepting a suspicion that these attentions wereintended to shake him in his religious profession?as indeedit was well known that the high esteem of the Europeanknowledge and courage made the Soldan unbounded in hisgifts to those who, having become his prisoners, had beeninduced to take the turban. Sir Kenneth, therefore, crossinghimself devoutly, resolved to set all such snares at defiance;and that he might do so the more firmly, conscientiouslydetermined to avail himself as moderately as possible of theattentions and luxuries thus liberally heaped upon him. Still,however, he felt his head oppressed and sleepy; and aware,too, that his undress was not fit for appearing abroad, hereclined upon the couch, and was again locked in the armsof slumber.But this time his rest was not unbroken, for he was awak-ened by the voice of the physician at the door of the tent,inquiring after his health, and whether he had rested suffi-ciently. ?May I enter your tent?? he concluded, ?for the cur-tain is drawn before the entrance.??The master,? replied Sir Kenneth, determined to showthat he was not surprised into forgetfulness of his own con-dition, ?need demand no permission to enter the tent of theslave.??But if I come not as a master?? said El Hakim, still with-out entering.?The physician,? answered the knight, ?hath free access tothe bedside of his patient.??Neither come I now as a physician,? replied El Hakim;?and therefore I still request permission, ere I come underthe covering of thy tent.??Whoever comes as a friend,? said Sir Kenneth, ?and suchthou hast hitherto shown thyself to me, the habitation of thefriend is ever open to him.??Yet once again,? said the Eastern sage, after theperiphrastical manner of his countrymen, ?supposing that Icome not as a friend???Come as thou wilt,? said the Scottish knight, somewhatimpatient of this circumlocution; ?be what thou wilt?thouknowest well it is neither in my power nor my inclination torefuse thee entrance.??I come, then,? said El Hakim, ?as your ancient foe, but a 257Sir Walter Scottfair and a generous one.?He entered as he spoke; and when he stood before thebedside of Sir Kenneth, the voice continued to be that ofAdonbec, the Arabian physician, but the form, dress, andfeatures were those of Ilderim of Kurdistan, called Sheerkohf.Sir Kenneth gazed upon him as if he expected the vision todepart, like something created by his imagination.?Doth it so surprise thee,? said Ilderim, ?and thou an ap-proved warrior, to see that a soldier knows somewhat of theart of healing? I say to thee, Nazarene, that an accomplishedcavalier should know how to dress his steed, as well as howto ride him; how to forge his sword upon the stithy, as wellas how to use it in battle; how to burnish his arms, as well ashow to wear them; and, above all, how to cure wounds, aswell as how to inflict them.?As he spoke, the Christian knight repeatedly shut his eyes,and while they remained closed, the idea of the Hakim, withhis long, flowing dark robes, high Tartar cap, and grave ges-tures was present to his imagination; but so soon as he openedthem, the graceful and richly-gemmed turban, the lighthauberk of steel rings entwisted with silver, which glancedbrilliantly as it obeyed every inflection of the body, the fea-tures freed from their formal expression, less swarthy, andno longer shadowed by the mass of hair (now limited to awell-trimmed beard), announced the soldier and not the sage.?Art thou still so much surprised,? said the Emir, ?and hastthou walked in the world with such little observance, as towonder that men are not always what they seem? Thou thy-self?art thou what thou seemest???No, by Saint Andrew!? exclaimed the knight; ?for to thewhole Christian camp I seem a traitor, and I know myself tobe a true though an erring man.??Even so I judged thee,? said Ilderim; ?and as we had eatensalt together, I deemed myself bound to rescue thee fromdeath and contumely. But wherefore lie you still on yourcouch, since the sun is high in the heavens? or are the vest-ments which my sumpter-camels have afforded unworthy ofyour wearing???Not unworthy, surely, but unfitting for it,? replied theScot. ?Give me the dress of a slave, noble Ilderim, and I willdon it with pleasure; but I cannot brook to wear the habit ofthe free Eastern warrior with the turban of the Moslem.? 258The Talisman?Nazarene,? answered the Emir, ?thy nation so easily en-tertain suspicion that it may well render themselves suspected.Have I not told thee that Saladin desires no converts savingthose whom the holy Prophet shall dispose to submit them-selves to his law? violence and bribery are alike alien to hisplan for extending the true faith. Hearken to me, my brother.When the blind man was miraculously restored to sight, thescales dropped from his eyes at the Divine pleasure. Think?stthou that any earthly leech could have removed them? No.Such mediciner might have tormented the patient with hisinstruments, or perhaps soothed him with his balsams andcordials, but dark as he was must the darkened man haveremained; and it is even so with the blindness of the under-standing. If there be those among the Franks who, for thesake of worldly lucre, have assumed the turban of the Prophet,and followed the laws of Islam, with their own consciencesbe the blame. Themselves sought out the bait; it was notflung to them by the Soldan. And when they shall hereafterbe sentenced, as hypocrites, to the lowest gulf of hell, belowChristian and Jew, magician and idolater, and condemnedto eat the fruit of the tree Yacoun, which is the heads ofdemons, to themselves, not to the Soldan, shall their guiltand their punishment be attributed. Wherefore wear, with-out doubt or scruple, the vesture prepared for you, since, ifyou proceed to the camp of Saladin, your own native dresswill expose you to troublesome observation, and perhaps toinsult.??If I go to the camp of Saladin?? said Sir Kenneth, repeat-ing the words of the Emir; ?alas! am I a free agent, and rathermust I not go wherever your pleasure carries me???Thine own will may guide thine own motions,? said theEmir, ?as freely as the wind which moveth the dust of thedesert in what direction it chooseth. The noble enemy whomet and well-nigh mastered my sword cannot become myslave like him who has crouched beneath it. If wealth andpower would tempt thee to join our people, I could ensurethy possessing them; but the man who refused the favours ofthe Soldan when the axe was at his head, will not, I fear, nowaccept them, when I tell him he has his free choice.??Complete your generosity, noble Emir,? said Sir Kenneth,?by forbearing to show me a mode of requital which con-science forbids me to comply with. Permit me rather to ex- 259Sir Walter Scottpress, as bound in courtesy, my gratitude for this most chiv-alrous bounty, this undeserved generosity.??Say not undeserved,? replied the Emir Ilderim. ?Was itnot through thy conversation, and thy account of the beau-ties which grace the court of the Melech Ric, that I venturedme thither in disguise, and thereby procured a sight the mostblessed that I have ever enjoyed?that I ever shall enjoy, untilthe glories of Paradise beam on my eyes???I understand you not,? said Sir Kenneth, colouring alter-nately, and turning pale, as one who felt that the conversa-tion was taking a tone of the most painful delicacy.?Not understand me!? exclaimed the Emir. ?If the sight Isaw in the tent of King Richard escaped thine observation, Iwill account it duller than the edge of a buffoon?s woodenfalchion. True, thou wert under sentence of death at the time;but, in my case, had my head been dropping from the trunk,the last strained glances of my eyeballs had distinguishedwith delight such a vision of loveliness, and the head wouldhave rolled itself towards the incomparable houris, to kisswith its quivering lips the hem of their vestments. Yonderroyalty of England, who for her superior loveliness deservesto be Queen of the universe?what tenderness in her blueeye, what lustre in her tresses of dishevelled gold! By thetomb of the Prophet, I scarce think that the houri who shallpresent to me the diamond cup of immortality will deserveso warm a caress!??Saracen,? said Sir Kenneth sternly, ?thou speakest of thewife of Richard of England, of whom men think not andspeak not as a woman to be won, but as a Queen to be re-vered.??I cry you mercy,? said the Saracen. ?I had forgotten yoursuperstitious veneration for the sex, which you consider ratherfit to be wondered at and worshipped than wooed and pos-sessed. I warrant, since thou exactest such profound respectto yonder tender piece of frailty, whose every motion, step,and look bespeaks her very woman, less than absolute ado-ration must not be yielded to her of the dark tresses andnobly speaking eye. she indeed, I will allow, hath in her nobleport and majestic mien something at once pure and firm;yet even she, when pressed by opportunity and a forwardlover, would, I warrant thee, thank him in her heart ratherfor treating her as a mortal than as a goddess.? 260The Talisman?Respect the kinswoman of Coeur de Lion!? said Sir Ken-neth, in a tone of unrepressed anger.?Respect her!? answered the Emir in scorn; ?by the Caaba,and if I do, it shall be rather as the bride of Saladin.??The infidel Soldan is unworthy to salute even a spot thathas been pressed by the foot of Edith Plantagenet!? exclaimedthe Christian, springing from his couch.?Ha! what said the Giaour?? exclaimed the Emir, layinghis hand on his poniard hilt, while his forehead glowed likeglancing copper, and the muscles of his lips and cheekswrought till each curl of his beard seemed to twist and screwitself, as if alive with instinctive wrath. But the Scottish knight,who had stood the lion-anger of Richard, was unappalled atthe tigerlike mood of the chafed Saracen.?What I have said,? continued Sir Kenneth, with foldedarms and dauntless look, ?I would, were my hands loose,maintain on foot or horseback against all mortals; and wouldhold it not the most memorable deed of my life to support itwith my good broadsword against a score of these sicklesand bodkins,? pointing at the curved sabre and small pon-iard of the Emir.The Saracen recovered his composure as the Christianspoke, so far as to withdraw his hand from his weapon, as ifthe motion had been without meaning, but still continuedin deep ire.?By the sword of the Prophet,? he said, ?which is the keyboth of heaven and hell, he little values his own life, brother,who uses the language thou dost! Believe me, that were thinehands loose, as thou term?st it, one single true believer wouldfind them so much to do that thou wouldst soon wish themfettered again in manacles of iron.??Sooner would I wish them hewn off by the shoulder-blades!? replied Sir Kenneth.?Well. Thy hands are bound at present,? said the Saracen,in a more amicable tone??bound by thine own gentle senseof courtesy; nor have I any present purpose of setting themat liberty. We have proved each other?s strength and courageere now, and we may again meet in a fair field?and shamebefall him who shall be the first to part from his foeman! Butnow we are friends, and I look for aid from thee rather thanhard terms or defiances.??We are friends,? repeated the knight; and there was a pause, 261Sir Walter Scottduring which the fiery Saracen paced the tent, like the lion,who, after violent irritation, is said to take that method ofcooling the distemperature of his blood, ere he stretches him-self to repose in his den. The colder European remained un-altered in posture and aspect; yet he, doubtless, was also en-gaged in subduing the angry feelings which had been so un-expectedly awakened.?Let us reason of this calmly,? said the Saracen. ?I am aphysician, as thou knowest, and it is written that he whowould have his wound cured must not shrink when the leechprobes and tests it. Seest thou, I am about to lay my fingeron the sore. Thou lovest this kinswoman of the Melech Ric.Unfold the veil that shrouds thy thoughts?or unfold it notif thou wilt, for mine eyes see through its coverings.??I loved her,? answered Sir Kenneth, after a pause, ?as aman loves Heaven?s grace, and sued for her favour like a sin-ner for Heaven?s pardon.??And you love her no longer?? said the Saracen.?Alas,? answered Sir Kenneth, ?I am no longer worthy tolove her. I pray thee cease this discourse?thy words are pon-iards to me.?Pardon me but a moment,? continued Ilderim. ?Whenthou, a poor and obscure soldier, didst so boldly and so highlyfix thine affection, tell me, hadst thou good hope of its is-sue???Love exists not without hope,? replied the knight; ?butmine was as nearly allied to despair as that of the sailor swim-ming for his life, who, as he surmounts billow after billow,catches by intervals some gleam of the distant beacon, whichshows him there is land in sight, though his sinking heartand wearied limbs assure him that he shall never reach it.??And now,? said Ilderim, ?these hopes are sunk?that soli-tary light is quenched for ever???For ever,? answered Sir Kenneth, in the tone of an echofrom the bosom of a ruined sepulchre.?Methinks,? said the Saracen, ?if all thou lackest were somesuch distant meteoric glimpse of happiness as thou hadstformerly, thy beacon-light might be rekindled, thy hopefished up from the ocean in which it has sunk, and thouthyself, good knight, restored to the exercise and amusementof nourishing thy fantastic fashion upon a diet as unsub-stantial as moonlight; for, if thou stood?st tomorrow fair in 262The Talismanreputation as ever thou wert, she whom thou lovest will notbe less the daughter of princes and the elected bride ofSaladin.??I would it so stood,? said the Scot, ?and if I did not??He stopped short, like a man who is afraid of boastingunder circumstances which did not permit his being put tothe test. The Saracen smiled as he concluded the sentence.?Thou wouldst challenge the. Soldan to single combat??said he.?And if I did,? said Sir Kenneth haughtily, ?Saladin?s wouldneither be the first nor the best turban that I have couchedlance at.??Ay, but methinks the Soldan might regard it as too un-equal a mode of perilling the chance of a royal bride and theevent of a great war,? said the Emir.?He may be met with in the front of battle,? said the knight,his eyes gleaming with the ideas which such a thought in-spired.?He has been ever found there,? said Ilderim; ?nor is it hiswont to turn his horse?s head from any brave encounter. Butit was not of the Soldan that I meant to speak. In a word, ifit will content thee to be placed in such reputation as may beattained by detection of the thief who stole the Banner ofEngland, I can put thee in a fair way of achieving this task?that is, if thou wilt be governed; for what says Lokman, ?Ifthe child would walk, the nurse must lead him; if the igno-rant would understand, the wise must instruct.???And thou art wise, Ilderim,? said the Scot??wise thougha Saracen, and generous though an infidel. I have witnessedthat thou art both. Take, then, the guidance of this matter;and so thou ask nothing of me contrary to my loyalty andmy Christian faith, I, will obey thee punctually. Do whatthou hast said, and take my life when it is accomplished.??Listen thou to me, then,? said the Saracen. ?Thy noblehound is now recovered, by the blessing of that divine medi-cine which healeth man and beast; and by his sagacity shallthose who assailed him be discovered.??Ha!? said the knight, ?methinks I comprehend thee. Iwas dull not to think of this!??But tell me,? added the Emir, ?hast thou any followers orretainers in the camp by whom the animal may be known???I dismissed,? said Sir Kenneth, ?my old attendant, thy 263Sir Walter Scottpatient, with a varlet that waited on him, at the time when Iexpected to suffer death, giving him letters for my friends inScotland; there are none other to whom the dog is familiar.But then my own person is well known?my very speechwill betray me, in a camp where I have played no mean partfor many months.??Both he and thou shalt be disguised, so as to escape evenclose examination. I tell thee,? said the Saracen, ?that notthy brother in arms?not thy brother in blood?shall dis-cover thee, if thou be guided by my counsels. Thou hast seenme do matters more difficult?he that can call the dyingfrom the darkness of the shadow of death can easily cast amist before the eyes of the living. But mark me: there is stillthe condition annexed to this service?that thou deliver aletter of Saladin to the niece of the Melech Ric, whose nameis as difficult to our Eastern tongue and lips, as her beauty isdelightful to our eyes.?Sir Kenneth paused before he answered, and the Saracenobserving his hesitation, demanded of him, ?if he feared toundertake this message???Not if there were death in the execution,? said Sir Ken-neth. ?I do but pause to consider whether it consists withmy honour to bear the letter of the Soldan, or with that ofthe Lady Edith to receive it from a heathen prince.??By the head of Mohammed, and by the honour of a sol-dier?by the tomb at Mecca, and by the soul of my father,?said the Emir, ?I swear to thee that the letter is written in allhonour and respect. The song of the nightingale will soonerblight the rose-bower she loves than will the words of theSoldan offend the ears of the lovely kinswoman of England.??Then,? said the knight, ?I will bear the Soldan?s letterfaithfully, as if I were his born vassal?understanding, thatbeyond this simple act of service, which I will render withfidelity, from me of all men he can least expect mediation oradvice in this his strange love-suit.??Saladin is noble,? answered the Emir, ?and will not spur agenerous horse to a leap which he cannot achieve. Comewith me to my tent,? he added, ?and thou shalt be presentlyequipped with a disguise as unsearchable as midnight, sothou mayest walk the camp of the Nazarenes as if thou hadston thy finger the signet of Giaougi.? [Perhaps the same withGyges.] 264The TalismanCHAPTER XXIV.A grain of dustSoiling our cup, will make our sense rejectFastidiously the draught which we did thirst for;A rusted nail, placed near the faithful compass,Will sway it from the truth, and wreck the argosy.Even this small cause of anger and disgustWill break the bonds of amity ?mongst princes,And wreck their noblest purposes.The Crusade.THE READER can now have little doubt who the Ethiopianslave really was, with what purpose he had sought Richard?scamp, and wherefore and with what hope he now stood closeto the person of that Monarch, as, surrounded by his valiantpeers of England and Normandy, Coeur de Lion stood onthe summit of Saint George?s Mount, with the Banner ofEngland by his side, borne by the most goodly person in thearmy, being his own natural brother, William with the LongSword, Earl of Salisbury, the offspring of Henry the Second?samour with the celebrated Rosamond of Woodstock.From several expressions in the King?s conversation withNeville on the preceding day, the Nubian was left in anxiousdoubt whether his disguise had not been penetrated, espe-cially as that the King seemed to be aware in what mannerthe agency of the dog was expected to discover the thief whostole the banner, although the circumstance of such ananimal?s having been wounded on the occasion had beenscarce mentioned in Richard?s presence. Nevertheless, as theKing continued to treat him in no other manner than hisexterior required, the Nubian remained uncertain whetherhe was or was not discovered, and determined not to throwhis disguise aside voluntarily.Meanwhile, the powers of the various Crusading princes,arrayed under their royal and princely leaders, swept in longorder around the base of the little mound; and as those ofeach different country passed by, their commanders advanceda step or two up the hill, and made a signal of courtesy toRichard and to the Standard of England, ?in sign of regardand amity,? as the protocol of the ceremony heedfully ex- 265Sir Walter Scottpressed it, ?not of subjection or vassalage.? The spiritual dig-nitaries, who in those days veiled not their bonnets to cre-ated being, bestowed on the King and his symbol of com-mand their blessing instead of rendering obeisance.Thus the long files marched on, and, diminished as theywere by so many causes, appeared still an iron host, to whomthe conquest of Palestine might seem an easy task. The sol-diers, inspired by the consciousness of united strength, saterect in their steel saddles; while it seemed that the trumpetssounded more cheerfully shrill, and the steeds, refreshed byrest and provender, chafed on the bit, and trod the groundmore proudly. On they passed, troop after troop, bannerswaving, spears glancing, plumes dancing, in long perspec-tive?a host composed of different nations, complexions,languages, arms, and appearances, but all fired, for the time,with the holy yet romantic purpose of rescuing the distresseddaughter of Zion from her thraldom, and redeeming the sa-cred earth, which more than mortal had trodden, from theyoke of the unbelieving pagan. And it must be owned that if,in other circumstances, the species of courtesy rendered to theKing of England by so many warriors, from whom he claimedno natural allegiance, had in it something that might havebeen thought humiliating, yet the nature and cause of the warwas so fitted to his pre-eminently chivalrous character andrenowned feats in arms, that claims which might elsewherehave been urged were there forgotten, and the brave did will-ing homage to the bravest, in an expedition where the mostundaunted and energetic courage was necessary to success.The good King was seated on horseback about half wayup the mount, a morion on his head, surmounted by a crown,which left his manly features exposed to public view, as, withcool and considerate eye, he perused each rank as it passedhim, and returned the salutation of the leaders. His tunicwas of sky-coloured velvet, covered with plates of silver, andhis hose of crimson silk, slashed with cloth of gold. By hisside stood the seeming Ethiopian slave, holding the nobledog in a leash, such as was used in woodcraft. It was a cir-cumstance which attracted no notice, for many of the princesof the Crusade had introduced black slaves into their house-hold, in imitation of the barbarous splendour of the Saracens.Over the King?s head streamed the large folds of the banner,and, as he looked to it from time to time, he seemed to re- 266The Talismangard a ceremony, indifferent to himself personally, as impor-tant, when considered as atoning an indignity offered to thekingdom which he ruled. In the background, and on thevery summit of the Mount, a wooden turret, erected for theoccasion, held the Queen Berengaria and the principal la-dies of the Court. To this the King looked from time to time;and then ever and anon his eyes were turned on the Nubianand the dog, but only when such leaders approached, as,from circumstances of previous ill-will, he suspected of be-ing accessory to the theft of the standard, or whom he judgedcapable of a crime so mean.Thus, he did not look in that direction when PhilipAugustus of France approached at the head of his splendidtroops of Gallic chivalry?nay, he anticipated the motionsof the French King, by descending the Mount as the lattercame up the ascent, so that they met in the middle space,and blended their greetings so gracefully that it appearedthey met in fraternal equality. The sight of the two greatestprinces in Europe, in rank at once and power, thus publiclyavowing their concord, called forth bursts of thundering ac-claim from the Crusading host at many miles distance, andmade the roving Arab scouts of the desert alarm the camp ofSaladin with intelligence that the army of the Christians wasin motion. Yet who but the King of kings can read the heartsof monarchs? Under this smooth show of courtesy, Richardnourished displeasure and suspicion against Philip, and Philipmeditated withdrawing himself and his host from the armyof the Cross, and leaving Richard to accomplish or fail in theenterprise with his own unassisted forces.Richard?s demeanour was different when the dark-armedknights and squires of the Temple chivalry approached?men with countenances bronzed to Asiatic blackness by thesuns of Palestine, and the admirable state of whose horsesand appointments far surpassed even that of the choicesttroops of France and England. The King cast a hasty glanceaside; but the Nubian stood quiet, and his trusty dog sat athis feet, watching, with a sagacious yet pleased look, the rankswhich now passed before them. The King?s look turned againon the chivalrous Templars, as the Grand Master, availinghimself of his mingled character, bestowed his benedictionon Richard as a priest, instead of doing him reverence as amilitary leader. 267Sir Walter Scott?The misproud and amphibious caitiff puts the monk uponme,? said Richard to the Earl of Salisbury. ?But, Longsword,we will let it pass. A punctilio must not lose Christendomthe services of these experienced lances, because their victo-ries have rendered them overweening. Lo you, here comesour valiant adversary, the Duke of Austria. Mark his mannerand bearing, Longsword?and thou, Nubian, let the houndhave full view of him. By Heaven, he brings his buffoonsalong with him!?In fact, whether from habit, or, which is more likely, tointimate contempt of the ceremonial he was about to com-ply with, Leopold was attended by his Spruch-Sprecher andhis jester; and as he advanced towards Richard, he whistledin what he wished to be considered as an indifferent man-ner, though his heavy features evinced the sullenness, mixedwith the fear, with which a truant schoolboy may be seen toapproach his master. As the reluctant dignitary made, withdiscomposed and sulky look, the obeisance required, theSpruch-Sprecher shook his baton, and proclaimed, like a her-ald, that, in what he was now doing, the Archduke of Aus-tria was not to be held derogating from the rank and privi-leges of a sovereign prince; to which the jester answered witha sonorous amen, which provoked much laughter among thebystanders.King Richard looked more than once at the Nubian andhis dog; but the former moved not, nor did the latter strainat the leash, so that Richard said to the slave with some scorn,?Thy success in this enterprise, my sable friend, even thoughthou hast brought thy hound?s sagacity to back thine own,will not, I fear, place thee high in the rank of wizards, ormuch augment thy merits towards our person.?The Nubian answered, as usual, only by a lowly obeisance.Meantime the troops of the Marquis of Montserrat nextpassed in order before the King of England. That powerfuland wily baron, to make the greater display of his forces, haddivided them into two bodies. At the head of the first, con-sisting of his vassals and followers, and levied from his Syr-ian possessions, came his brother Enguerrand; and he him-self followed, leading on a gallant band of twelve hundredStradiots, a kind of light cavalry raised by the Venetians intheir Dalmatian possessions, and of which they had entrustedthe command to the Marquis, with whom the republic had 268The Talismanmany bonds of connection. These Stradiots were clothed ina fashion partly European, but partaking chiefly of the East-ern fashion. They wore, indeed, short hauberks, but had overthem party-coloured tunics of rich stuffs, with large widepantaloons and half-boots. On their heads were straight up-right caps, similar to those of the Greeks; and they carriedsmall round targets, bows and arrows, scimitars, and pon-iards. They were mounted on horses carefully selected, andwell maintained at the expense of the State of Venice; theirsaddles and appointments resembled those of the Turks, andthey rode in the same manner, with short stirrups and upona high seat. These troops were of great use in skirmishingwith the Arabs, though unable to engage in close combat,like the iron-sheathed men-at-arms of Western and North-ern Europe.Before this goodly band came Conrade, in the same garbwith the Stradiots, but of such rich stuff that he seemed toblaze with gold and silver, and the milk-white plume fas-tened in his cap by a clasp of diamonds seemed tall enoughto sweep the clouds. The noble steed which he reinedbounded and caracoled, and displayed his spirit and agilityin a manner which might have troubled a less admirablehorseman than the Marquis, who gracefully ruled him withthe one hand, while the other displayed the baton, whosepredominancy over the ranks which he led seemed equallyabsolute. Yet his authority over the Stradiots was more inshow than in substance; for there paced beside him, on anambling palfrey of soberest mood, a little old man, dressedentirely in black, without beard or moustaches, and havingan appearance altogether mean and insignificant when com-pared with the blaze of splendour around him. But this mean-looking old man was one of those deputies whom the Vene-tian government sent into camps to overlook the conduct ofthe generals to whom the leading was consigned, and tomaintain that jealous system of espial and control which hadlong distinguished the policy of the republic.Conrade, who, by cultivating Richard?s humour, had at-tained a certain degree of favour with him, no sooner wascome within his ken than the King of England descended astep or two to meet him, exclaiming, at the same time, ?Ha,Lord Marquis, thou at the head of the fleet Stradiots, andthy black shadow attending thee as usual, whether the sun 269Sir Walter Scottshines or not! May not one ask thee whether the rule of thetroops remains with the shadow or the substance??Conrade was commencing his reply with a smile, whenRoswal, the noble hound, uttering a furious and savage yell,sprung forward. The Nubian, at the same time, slipped theleash, and the hound, rushing on, leapt upon Conrade?s noblecharger, and, seizing the Marquis by the throat, pulled himdown from the saddle. The plumed rider lay rolling on thesand, and the frightened horse fled in wild career throughthe camp.?Thy hound hath pulled down the right quarry, I warranthim,? said the King to the Nubian, ?and I vow to Saint Georgehe is a stag of ten tynes! Pluck the dog off; lest he throttlehim.?The Ethiopian, accordingly, though not without difficulty,disengaged the dog from Conrade, and fastened him up, stillhighly excited, and struggling in the leash. Meanwhile manycrowded to the spot, especially followers of Conrade andofficers of the Stradiots, who, as they saw their leader liegazing wildly on the sky, raised him up amid a tumultuarycry of ?Cut the slave and his hound to pieces!?But the voice of Richard, loud and sonorous, was heardclear above all other exclamations. ?He dies the death whoinjures the hound! He hath but done his duty, after the sa-gacity with which God and nature have endowed the braveanimal.?Stand forward for a false traitor, thou Conrade,Marquis of Montserrat! I impeach thee of treason.?Several of the Syrian leaders had now come up, andConrade?vexation, and shame, and confusion strugglingwith passion in his manner and voice?exclaimed, ?Whatmeans this? With what am I charged? Why this base usageand these reproachful terms? Is this the league of concordwhich England renewed but so lately???Are the Princes of the Crusade turned hares or deers inthe eyes of King Richard that he should slip hounds on them??said the sepulchral voice of the Grand Master of the Templars.?It must be some singular accident?some fatal mistake,?said Philip of France, who rode up at the same moment.?Some deceit of the Enemy,? said the Archbishop of Tyre.?A stratagem of the Saracens,? cried Henry of Champagne.?It were well to hang up the dog, and put the slave to thetorture.? 270The Talisman?Let no man lay hand upon them,? said Richard, ?as heloves his own life! Conrade, stand forth, if thou darest, anddeny the accusation which this mute animal hath in his nobleinstinct brought against thee, of injury done to him, andfoul scorn to England!??I never touched the banner,? said Conrade hastily.?Thy words betray thee, Conrade!? said Richard, ?for howdidst thou know, save from conscious guilt, that the ques-tion is concerning the banner???Hast thou then not kept the camp in turmoil on that andno other score?? answered Conrade; ?and dost thou imputeto a prince and an ally a crime which, after all, was probablycommitted by some paltry felon for the sake of the goldthread? Or wouldst thou now impeach a confederate on thecredit of a dog??By this time the alarm was becoming general, so that Philipof France interposed.?Princes and nobles,? he said, ?you speak in presence ofthose whose swords will soon be at the throats of each otherif they hear their leaders at such terms together. In the nameof Heaven, let us draw off each his own troops into theirseparate quarters, and ourselves meet an hour hence in thePavilion of Council to take some order in this new state ofconfusion.??Content,? said King Richard, ?though I should have likedto have interrogated that caitiff while his gay doublet was yetbesmirched with sand. But the pleasure of France shall beours in this matter.?The leaders separated as was proposed, each prince plac-ing himself at the head of his own forces; and then was heardon all sides the crying of war-cries and the sounding of gath-ering-notes upon bugles and trumpets, by which the differ-ent stragglers were summoned to their prince?s banner, andthe troops were shortly seen in motion, each taking differentroutes through the camp to their own quarters. But althoughany immediate act of violence was thus prevented, yet theaccident which had taken place dwelt on every mind; andthose foreigners who had that morning hailed Richard asthe worthiest to lead their army, now resumed their preju-dices against his pride and intolerance, while the English,conceiving the honour of their country connected with thequarrel, of which various reports had gone about, consid- 271Sir Walter Scottered the natives of other countries jealous of the fame ofEngland and her King, and disposed to undermine it by themeanest arts of intrigue. Many and various were the rumoursspread upon the occasion, and there was one which averredthat the Queen and her ladies had been much alarmed bythe tumult, and that one of them had swooned.The Council assembled at the appointed hour. Conradehad in the meanwhile laid aside his dishonoured dress, andwith it the shame and confusion which, in spite of his tal-ents and promptitude, had at first overwhelmed him, owingto the strangeness of the accident and suddenness of the ac-cusation. He was now robed like a prince; and entered thecouncil-chamber attended by the Archduke of Austria, theGrand Masters both of the Temple and of the Order of SaintJohn, and several other potentates, who made a show of sup-porting him and defending his cause, chiefly perhaps frompolitical motives, or because they themselves nourished apersonal enmity against Richard.This appearance of union in favour of Conrade was farfrom influencing the King of England. He entered the Coun-cil with his usual indifference of manner, and in the samedress in which he had just alighted from horseback. He casta careless and somewhat scornful glance on the leaders, whohad with studied affectation arranged themselves aroundConrade as if owning his cause, and in the most direct termscharged Conrade of Montserrat with having stolen the Ban-ner of England, and wounded the faithful animal who stoodin its defence.Conrade arose boldly to answer, and in despite, as he ex-pressed himself, of man and brute, king or dog, avouchedhis innocence of the crime charged.?Brother of England,? said Philip, who willingly assumedthe character of moderator of the assembly, ?this is an un-usual impeachment. We do not hear you avouch your ownknowledge of this matter, further than your belief restingupon the demeanour of this hound towards the Marquis ofMontserrat. Surely the word of a knight and a prince shouldbear him out against the barking of a cur???Royal brother,? returned Richard, ?recollect that the Al-mighty, who gave the dog to be companion of our pleasuresand our toils, hath invested him with a nature noble andincapable of deceit. He forgets neither friend nor foe?re- 272The Talismanmembers, and with accuracy, both benefit and injury. Hehath a share of man?s intelligence, but no share of man?s false-hood. You may bribe a soldier to slay a man with his sword,or a witness to take life by false accusation; but you cannotmake a hound tear his benefactor. He is the friend of man,save when man justly incurs his enmity. Dress yonder mar-quis in what peacock-robes you will, disguise his appearance,alter his complexion with drugs and washes, hide him amidsta hundred men,?I will yet pawn my sceptre that the hounddetects him, and expresses his resentment, as you have thisday beheld. This is no new incident, although a strange one.Murderers and robbers have been ere now convicted, andsuffered death under such evidence, and men have said thatthe finger of God was in it. In thine own land, royal brother,and upon such an occasion, the matter was tried by a solemnduel betwixt the man and the dog, as appellant and defen-dant in a challenge of murder. The dog was victorious, theman was punished, and the crime was confessed. Credit me,royal brother, that hidden crimes have often been broughtto light by the testimony even of inanimate substances, notto mention animals far inferior in instinctive sagacity to thedog, who is the friend and companion of our race.??Such a duel there hath indeed been, royal brother,? an-swered Philip, ?and that in the reign of one of our predeces-sors, to whom God be gracious. But it was in the olden time,nor can we hold it a precedent fitting for this occasion. Thedefendant in that case was a private gentleman of small rankor respect; his offensive weapons were only a club, his defen-sive a leathern jerkin. But we cannot degrade a prince to thedisgrace of using such rude arms, or to the ignominy of sucha combat.??I never meant that you should,? said King Richard; ?itwere foul play to hazard the good hound?s life against that ofsuch a double-faced traitor as this Conrade hath proved him-self. But there lies our own glove; we appeal him to the com-bat in respect of the evidence we brought forth against him.A king, at least, is more than the mate of a marquis.?Conrade made no hasty effort to seize on the pledge whichRichard cast into the middle of the assembly, and King Philiphad time to reply ere the marquis made a motion to lift the glove.?A king,? said he of France, ?is as much more than a matchfor the Marquis Conrade as a dog would be less. Royal Rich- 273Sir Walter Scottard, this cannot be permitted. You are the leader of our expe-dition?the sword and buckler of Christendom.??I protest against such a combat,? said the Venetianproveditore, ?until the King of England shall have repaid thefifty thousand byzants which he is indebted to the republic.It is enough to be threatened with loss of our debt, shouldour debtor fall by the hands of the pagans, without the addi-tional risk of his being slain in brawls amongst Christiansconcerning dogs and banners.??And I,? said William with the Long Sword, Earl ofSalisbury, ?protest in my turn against my royal brotherperilling his life, which is the property of the people of En-gland, in such a cause. Here, noble brother, receive back yourglove, and think only as if the wind had blown it from yourhand. Mine shall lie in its stead. A king?s son, though withthe bar sinister on his shield, is at least a match for this mar-moset of a marquis.??Princes and nobles,? said Conrade, ?I will not accept ofKing Richard?s defiance. He hath been chosen our leaderagainst the Saracens, and if his conscience can answer theaccusation of provoking an ally to the field on a quarrel sofrivolous, mine, at least, cannot endure the reproach of ac-cepting it. But touching his bastard brother, William ofWoodstock, or against any other who shall adopt or shalldare to stand godfather to this most false charge, I will de-fend my honour in the lists, and prove whosoever impeachesit a false liar.??The Marquis of Montserrat,? said the Archbishop of Tyre,?hath spoken like a wise and moderate gentleman; andmethinks this controversy might, without dishonour to anyparty, end at this point.??Methinks it might so terminate,? said the King of France,?provided King Richard will recall his accusation as madeupon over-slight grounds.??Philip of France,? answered Coeur de Lion, ?my wordsshall never do my thoughts so much injury. I have chargedyonder Conrade as a thief, who, under cloud of night, stolefrom its place the emblem of England?s dignity. I still believeand charge him to be such; and when a day is appointed forthe combat, doubt not that, since Conrade declines to meetus in person, I will find a champion to appear in support ofmy challenge?for thou, William, must not thrust thy long 274The Talismansword into this quarrel without our special license.??Since my rank makes me arbiter in this most unhappymatter,? said Philip of France, ?I appoint the fifth day fromhence for the decision thereof, by way of combat, accordingto knightly usage?Richard, King of England, to appear byhis champion as appellant, and Conrade, Marquis ofMontserrat, in his own person, as defendant. Yet I own Iknow not where to find neutral ground where such a quarrelmay be fought out; for it must not be in the neighbourhoodof this camp, where the soldiers would make faction on thedifferent sides.??It were well,? said Richard, ?to apply to the generosity ofthe royal Saladin, since, heathen as he is, I have never knownknight more fulfilled of nobleness, or to whose good faithwe may so peremptorily entrust ourselves. I speak thus forthose who may be doubtful of mishap; for myself, whereverI see my foe, I make that spot my battle-ground.??Be it so,? said Philip; ?we will make this matter known toSaladin, although it be showing to an enemy the unhappyspirit of discord which we would willingly hide from evenourselves, were it possible. Meanwhile, I dismiss this assem-bly, and charge you all, as Christian men and noble knights,that ye let this unhappy feud breed no further brawling inthe camp, but regard it as a thing solemnly referred to thejudgment of God, to whom each of you should pray that Hewill dispose of victory in the combat according to the truthof the quarrel; and therewith may His will be done!??Amen, amen!? was answered on all sides; while the Templarwhispered the Marquis, ?Conrade, wilt thou not add a peti-tion to be delivered from the power of the dog, as the Psalm-ist hath it???Peace, thou?!? replied the Marquis; ?there is a revealingdemon abroad which may report, amongst other tidings, howfar thou dost carry the motto of thy order? ?Feriaur Leo.??Thou wilt stand the brunt of challenge?? said the Templar.?Doubt me not,? said Conrade. ?I would not, indeed, havewillingly met the iron arm of Richard himself, and I shamenot to confess that I rejoice to be free of his encounter; but,from his bastard brother downward, the man breathes notin his ranks whom I fear to meet.??It is well you are so confident,? continued the Templar;?and, in that case, the fangs of yonder hound have done more 275Sir Walter Scottto dissolve this league of princes than either thy devices orthe dagger of the Charegite. Seest thou how, under a browstudiously overclouded, Philip cannot conceal the satisfac-tion which he feels at the prospect of release from the alli-ance which sat so heavy on him? Mark how Henry of Cham-pagne smiles to himself, like a sparkling goblet of his ownwine; and see the chuckling delight of Austria, who thinkshis quarrel is about to be avenged without risk or trouble ofhis own. Hush! he approaches.?A most grievous chance,most royal Austria, that these breaches in the walls of ourZion???If thou meanest this Crusade,? replied the Duke, ?I wouldit were crumbled to pieces, and each were safe at home! Ispeak this in confidence.??But,? said the Marquis of Montserrat, ?to think this dis-union should be made by the hands of King Richard, forwhose pleasure we have been contented to endure so much,and to whom we have been as submissive as slaves to a mas-ter, in hopes that he would use his valour against our en-emies, instead of exercising it upon our friends!??I see not that he is so much more valorous than others,?said the Archduke. ?I believe, had the noble Marquis methim in the lists, he would have had the better; for thoughthe islander deals heavy blows with the pole-axe, he is not sovery dexterous with the lance. I should have cared little tohave met him myself on our old quarrel, had the weal ofChristendom permitted to sovereign princes to breathe them-selves in the lists; and if thou desirest it, noble Marquis, Iwill myself be your godfather in this combat.??And I also,? said the Grand Master.?Come, then, and take your nooning in our tent, noblesirs,? said the Duke, ?and we?ll speak of this business oversome right nierenstein.?They entered together accordingly.?What said our patron and these great folks together?? saidJonas Schwanker to his companion, the Spruch-Sprecher, whohad used the freedom to press nigh to his master when theCouncil was dismissed, while the jester waited at a more re-spectful distance.?Servant of Folly,? said the Spruch-Sprecher, ?moderate thycuriosity; it beseems not that I should tell to thee the coun-sels of our master.? 276The Talisman?Man of wisdom, you mistake,? answered Jonas. ?We areboth the constant attendants on our patron, and it concernsus alike to know whether thou or I?Wisdom or Folly?have the deeper interest in him.??He told to the Marquis,? answered the Spruch-Sprecher,?and to the Grand Master, that he was aweary of these wars,and would be glad he was safe at home.??That is a drawn cast, and counts for nothing in the game,?said the jester; ?it was most wise to think thus, but greatfolly to tell it to others?proceed.??Ha, hem!? said the Spruch-Sprecher; ?he next said to themthat Richard was not more valorous than others, or over-dexterous in the tilt-yard.??Woodcock of my side,? said Schwanker, ?this was egre-gious folly. What next???Nay, I am something oblivious,? replied the man of wis-dom?? he invited them to a goblet of nierenstein.??That hath a show of wisdom in it,? said Jonas. ?Thoumayest mark it to thy credit in the meantime; but an hedrink too much, as is most likely, I will have it pass to mine.Anything more???Nothing worth memory,? answered the orator; ?only hewished he had taken the occasion to meet Richard in thelists.??Out upon it?out upon it!? said Jonas; ?this is such dot-age of folly that I am well-nigh ashamed of winning the gameby it. Ne?ertheless, fool as he is, we will follow him, mostsage Spruch-Sprecher, and have our share of the wine ofnierenstein.? 277Sir Walter ScottCHAPTER XXV.Yet this inconstancy is such,As thou, too, shalt adore;I could not love thee, love so much,Loved I not honour more.Montrose?s Lines.WHEN KING RICHARD returned to his tent, he commandedthe Nubian to be brought before him. He entered with hisusual ceremonial reverence, and having prostrated himself,remained standing before the King in the attitude of a slaveawaiting the orders of his master. It was perhaps well for himthat the preservation of his character required his eyes to befixed on the ground, since the keen glance with which Rich-ard for some time surveyed him in silence would, if fullyencountered, have been difficult to sustain.?Thou canst well of woodcraft,? said the King, after a pause,?and hast started thy game and brought him to bay as ably asif Tristrem himself had taught thee. [A universal traditionascribed to Sir Tristrem, famous for his lore of the fair QueenYseult, the laws concerning the practice of woodcraft, orvenerie, as it was called, being those that related to the rulesof the chase, which were deemed of much consequence dur-ing the Middle Ages.] But this is not all?he must be broughtdown at force. I myself would have liked to have levelled myhunting-spear at him. There are, it seems, respects whichprevent this. Thou art about to return to the camp of theSoldan, bearing a letter, requiring of his courtesy to appointneutral ground for the deed of chivalry, and should it consistwith his pleasure, to concur with us in witnessing it. Now,speaking conjecturally, we think thou mightst find in thatcamp some cavalier who, for the love of truth and his ownaugmentation of honour, will do battle with this same trai-tor of Montserrat.?The Nubian raised his eyes and fixed them on the Kingwith a look of eager ardour; then raised them to Heavenwith such solemn gratitude that the water soon glistened inthem; then bent his head, as affirming what Richard desired,and resumed his usual posture of submissive attention.?It is well,? said the King; ?and I see thy desire to oblige 278The Talismanme in this matter. And herein, I must needs say, lies the ex-cellence of such a servant as thou, who hast not speech ei-ther to debate our purpose or to require explanation of whatwe have determined. An English serving man in thy placehad given me his dogged advice to trust the combat withsome good lance of my household, who, from my brotherLongsword downwards, are all on fire to do battle in mycause; and a chattering Frenchman had made a thousandattempts to discover wherefore I look for a champion fromthe camp of the infidels. But thou, my silent agent, canst domine errand without questioning or comprehending it; withthee to hear is to obey.?A bend of the body and a genuflection were the appropri-ate answer of the Ethiopian to these observations.?And now to another point,? said the King, and speakingsuddenly and rapidly??have you yet seen EdithPlantagenet??The mute looked up as in the act of being about to speak?nay, his lips had begun to utter a distinct negative?whenthe abortive attempt died away in the imperfect murmurs ofthe dumb.?Why, lo you there!? said the King, ?the very sound of thename of a royal maiden of beauty so surpassing as that of ourlovely cousin seems to have power enough well-nigh to makethe dumb speak. What miracles then might her eye workupon such a subject! I will make the experiment, friend slave.Thou shalt see this choice beauty of our Court, and do theerrand of the princely Soldan.?Again a joyful glance?again a genuflection?but, as hearose, the King laid his hand heavily on his shoulder, andproceeded with stern gravity thus: ?Let me in one thing warnyou, my sable envoy. Even if thou shouldst feel that the kindlyinfluence of her whom thou art soon to behold should loosenthe bonds of thy tongue, presently imprisoned, as the goodSoldan expresses it, within the ivory walls of its castle, be-ware how thou changest thy taciturn character, or speakest aword in her presence, even if thy powers of utterance were tobe miraculously restored. Believe me that I should have thytongue extracted by the roots, and its ivory palace?that is, Ipresume, its range of teeth?drawn out one by one. Where-fore, be wise and silent still.?The Nubian, so soon as the King had removed his heavy 279Sir Walter Scottgrasp from his shoulder, bent his head, and laid his hand onhis lips, in token of silent obedience.But Richard again laid his hand on him more gently, andadded, ?This behest we lay on thee as on a slave. Wert thouknight and gentleman, we would require thine honour inpledge of thy silence, which is one especial condition of ourpresent trust.?The Ethiopian raised his body proudly, looked full at theKing, and laid his right hand on his heart.Richard then summoned his chamberlain.?Go, Neville,? he said, ?with this slave to the tent of ourroyal consort, and say it is our pleasure that he have an audi-ence?a private audience?of our cousin Edith. He is chargedwith a commission to her. Thou canst show him the wayalso, in case he requires thy guidance, though thou maysthave observed it is wonderful how familiar he already seemsto be with the purlieus of our camp.?And thou, too, friendEthiop,? the King continued, ?what thou dost do quickly,and return hither within the half-hour.??I stand discovered,? thought the seeming Nubian, as, withdowncast looks and folded arms, he followed the hasty strideof Neville towards the tent of Queen Berengaria??I standundoubtedly discovered and unfolded to King Richard; yetI cannot perceive that his resentment is hot against me. If Iunderstand his words?and surely it is impossible to misin-terpret them?he gives me a noble chance of redeeming myhonour upon the crest of this false Marquis, whose guilt Iread in his craven eye and quivering lip when the charge wasmade against him.?Roswal, faithfully hast thou served thymaster, and most dearly shall thy wrong be avenged!?Butwhat is the meaning of my present permission to look uponher whom I had despaired ever to see again? And why, orhow, can the royal Plantagenet consent that I should see hisdivine kinswoman, either as the messenger of the heathenSaladin, or as the guilty exile whom he so lately expelledfrom his camp?his audacious avowal of the affection whichis his pride being the greatest enhancement of his guilt? ThatRichard should consent to her receiving a letter from an in-fidel lover by the hands of one of such disproportioned rankare either of them circumstances equally incredible, and, atthe same time, inconsistent with each other. But Richard,when unmoved by his heady passions, is liberal, generous, 280The Talismanand truly noble; and as such I will deal with him, and actaccording to his instructions, direct or implied, seeking to knowno more than may gradually unfold itself without my offi-cious inquiry. To him who has given me so brave an opportu-nity to vindicate my tarnished honour, I owe acquiescenceand obedience; and painful as it may be, the debt shall bepaid. And yet??thus the proud swelling of his heart furthersuggested??Coeur de Lion, as he is called, might have mea-sured the feelings of others by his own. I urge an address to hiskinswoman! I, who never spoke word to her when I took aroyal prize from her hand?when I was accounted not thelowest in feats of chivalry among the defenders of the Cross! Iapproach her when in a base disguise, and in a servile habit?and, alas! when my actual condition is that of a slave, with aspot of dishonour on that which was once my shield! I do this!He little knows me. Yet I thank him for the opportunity whichmay make us all better acquainted with each other.?As he arrived at this conclusion, they paused before theentrance of the Queen?s pavilion.They were of course admitted by the guards, and Neville,leaving the Nubian in a small apartment, or antechamber,which was but too well remembered by him, passed into thatwhich was used as the Queen?s presence-chamber. He com-municated his royal master?s pleasure in a low and respectfultone of voice, very different from the bluntness of Thomas deVaux, to whom Richard was everything and the rest of theCourt, including Berengaria herself, was nothing. A burst oflaughter followed the communication of his errand.?And what like is the Nubian slave who comes ambassadoron such an errand from the Soldan??a negro, De Neville, ishe not?? said a female voice, easily recognized for that ofBerengaria. ?A negro, is he not, De Neville, with black skin,a head curled like a ram?s, a flat nose, and blubber lips?ha,worthy Sir Henry???Let not your Grace forget the shin-bones,? said anothervoice, ?bent outwards like the edge of a Saracen scimitar.??Rather like the bow of a Cupid, since he comes upon alover?s errand,? said the Queen.??Gentle Neville, thou artever prompt to pleasure us poor women, who have so littleto pass away our idle moments. We must see this messengerof love. Turks and Moors have I seen many, but negro never.??I am created to obey your Grace?s commands, so you will 281Sir Walter Scottbear me out with my Sovereign for doing so,? answered thedebonair knight. ?Yet, let me assure your Grace you will seesomething different from what you expect.??So much the better?uglier yet than our imaginations canfancy, yet the chosen love-messenger of this gallant Soldan!??Gracious madam,? said the Lady Calista, ?may I imploreyou would permit the good knight to carry this messengerstraight to the Lady Edith, to whom his credentials are ad-dressed? We have already escaped hardly for such a frolic.??Escaped?? repeated the Queen scornfully. ?Yet thou mayestbe right, Calista, in thy caution. Let this Nubian, as thoucallest him, first do his errand to our cousin?besides, he ismute too, is he not???He is, gracious madam,? answered the knight.?Royal sport have these Eastern ladies,? said Berengaria,?attended by those before whom they may say anything, yetwho can report nothing. Whereas in our camp, as the Prel-ate of Saint Jude?s is wont to say, a bird of the air will carrythe matter.??Because,? said De Neville, ?your Grace forgets that youspeak within canvas walls.?The voices sunk on this observation, and after a little whis-pering, the English knight again returned to the Ethiopian,and made him a sign to follow. He did so, and Neville con-ducted him to a pavilion, pitched somewhat apart from thatof the Queen, for the accommodation, it seemed, of the LadyEdith and her attendants. One of her Coptic maidens re-ceived the message communicated by Sir Henry Neville, andin the space of a very few minutes the Nubian was usheredinto Edith?s presence, while Neville was left on the outside ofthe tent. The slave who introduced him withdrew on a sig-nal from her mistress, and it was with humiliation, not ofthe posture only but of the very inmost soul, that the unfor-tunate knight, thus strangely disguised, threw himself on oneknee, with looks bent on the ground and arms folded on hisbosom, like a criminal who expects his doom. Edith was cladin the same manner as when she received King Richard, herlong, transparent dark veil hanging around her like the shadeof a summer night on a beautiful landscape, disguising andrendering obscure the beauties which it could not hide. Sheheld in her hand a silver lamp, fed with some aromatic spirit,which burned with unusual brightness. 282The TalismanWhen Edith came within a step of the kneeling and mo-tionless slave, she held the light towards his face, as if toperuse his features more attentively, then turned from him,and placed her lamp so as to throw the shadow of his face inprofile upon the curtain which hung beside. She at lengthspoke in a voice composed, yet deeply sorrowful,?Is it you? It is indeed you, brave Knight of the Leopard?gallant Sir Kenneth of Scotland; is it indeed you??thusservilely disguised?thus surrounded by a hundred dangers.?At hearing the tones of his lady?s voice thus unexpectedlyaddressed to him, and in a tone of compassion approachingto tenderness, a corresponding reply rushed to the knight?slips, and scarce could Richard?s commands and his own prom-ised silence prevent his answering that the sight he saw, thesounds he just heard, were sufficient to recompense the sla-very of a life, and dangers which threatened that life everyhour. He did recollect himself, however, and a deep and im-passioned sigh was his only reply to the high-born Edith?squestion.?I see?I know I have guessed right,? continued Edith. ?Imarked you from your first appearance near the platform onwhich I stood with the Queen. I knew, too, your valianthound. She is no true lady, and is unworthy of the service ofsuch a knight as thou art, from whom disguises of dress orhue could conceal a faithful servant. Speak, then, withoutfear to Edith Plantagenet. She knows how to grace in adver-sity the good knight who served, honoured, and did deedsof arms in her name, when fortune befriended him.?Stillsilent! Is it fear or shame that keeps thee so! Fear should beunknown to thee; and for shame, let it remain with thosewho have wronged thee.?The knight, in despair at being obliged to play the mute inan interview so interesting, could only express his mortifica-tion by sighing deeply, and laying his finger upon his lips.Edith stepped back, as if somewhat displeased.What!? she said, ?the Asiatic mute in very deed, as well asin attire? This I looked not for. Or thou mayest scorn me,perhaps, for thus boldly acknowledging that I have heed-fully observed the homage thou hast paid me? Hold no un-worthy thoughts of Edith on that account. She knows wellthe bounds which reserve and modesty prescribe to high-born maidens, and she knows when and how far they should 283Sir Walter Scottgive place to gratitude?to a sincere desire that it were in herpower to repay services and repair injuries arising from thedevotion which a good knight bore towards her. Why foldthy hands together, and wring them with so much passion?Can it be,? she added, shrinking back at the idea, ?that theircruelty has actually deprived thee of speech? Thou shakestthy head. Be it a spell?be it obstinacy, I question thee nofurther, but leave thee to do thine errand after thine ownfashion. I also can be mute.?The disguised knight made an action as if at once lament-ing his own condition and deprecating her displeasure, whileat the same time he presented to her, wrapped, as usual, infine silk and cloth of gold, the letter of the Soldan. She tookit, surveyed it carelessly, then laid it aside, and bending hereyes once more on the knight, she said in a low tone, ?Noteven a word to do thine errand to me??He pressed both his hands to his brow, as if to intimate thepain which he felt at being unable to obey her; but she turnedfrom him in anger.?Begone!? she said. ?I have spoken enough?too much?to one who will not waste on me a word in reply. Begone!?and say, if I have wronged thee, I have done penance; for if Ihave been the unhappy means of dragging thee down from astation of honour, I have, in this interview, forgotten myown worth, and lowered myself in thy eyes and in my own.?She covered her eyes with her hands, and seemed deeplyagitated. Sir Kenneth would have approached, but she wavedhim back.?Stand off! thou whose soul Heaven hath suited to its newstation! Aught less dull and fearful than a slavish mute hadspoken a word of gratitude, were it but to reconcile me tomy own degradation. Why pause you??begone!?The disguised knight almost involuntarily looked towardsthe letter as an apology for protracting his stay. She snatchedit up, saying in a tone of irony and contempt, ?I had forgot-ten?the dutiful slave waits an answer to his message. How?sthis?from the Soldan!?She hastily ran over the contents, which were expressedboth in Arabic and French, and when she had done, shelaughed in bitter anger.?Now this passes imagination!? she said; ?no jongleur canshow so deft a transmutation! His legerdemain can trans- 284The Talismanform zechins and byzants into doits and maravedis; but canhis art convert a Christian knight, ever esteemed among thebravest of the Holy Crusade, into the dust-kissing slave of aheathen Soldan?the bearer of a paynim?s insolent proposalsto a Christian maiden?nay, forgetting the laws ofhonourable chivalry, as well as of religion? But it avails nottalking to the willing slave of a heathen hound. Tell yourmaster, when his scourge shall have found thee a tongue,that which thou hast seen me do??so saying, she threw theSoldan?s letter on the ground, and placed her foot upon it??and say to him, that Edith Plantagenet scorns the homageof an unchristened pagan.?With these words she was about to shoot from the knight,when, kneeling at her feet in bitter agony, he ventured to layhis hand upon her robe and oppose her departure.?Heard?st thou not what I said, dull slave?? she said, turn-ing short round on him, and speaking with emphasis. ?Tellthe heathen Soldan, thy master, that I scorn his suit as muchas I despise the prostration of a worthless renegade to reli-gion and chivalry?to God and to his lady!?So saying, she burst from him, tore her garment from hisgrasp, and left the tent.The voice of Neville, at the same time, summoned himfrom without. Exhausted and stupefied by the distress hehad undergone during this interview, from which he couldonly have extricated himself by breach of the engagementwhich he had formed with King Richard, the unfortunateknight staggered rather than walked after the English baron,till they reached the royal pavilion, before which a party ofhorsemen had just dismounted. There were light and mo-tion within the tent, and when Neville entered with his dis-guised attendant, they found the King, with several of hisnobility, engaged in welcoming those who were newly ar-rived. 285Sir Walter ScottCHAPTER XXVI.?The tears I shed must ever fall.I weep not for an absent swain;For time may happier hours recall,And parted lovers meet again.?I weep not for the silent dead.Their pains are past, their sorrows o?er;And those that loved their steps must tread,When death shall join to part no more.?But worse than absence, worse than death,She wept her lover?s sullied fame,And, fired with all the pride of birth,She wept a soldier?s injured name.Ballad.THE FRANK AND BOLD VOICE of Richard was heard in joyousgratulation.?Thomas de Vaux! stout Tom of the Gills! by the head ofKing Henry, thou art welcome to me as ever was flask ofwine to a jolly toper! I should scarce have known how toorder my battle-array, unless I had thy bulky form in mineeye as a landmark to form my ranks upon. We shall haveblows anon, Thomas, if the saints be gracious to us; and hadwe fought in thine absence, I would have looked to hear ofthy being found hanging upon an elder-tree.??I should have borne my disappointment with more Chris-tian patience, I trust,? said Thomas de Vaux, ?than to havedied the death of an apostate. But I thank your Grace for mywelcome, which is the more generous, as it respects a banquetof blows, of which, saving your pleasure, you are ever too aptto engross the larger share. But here have I brought one towhom your Grace will, I know, give a yet warmer welcome.?The person who now stepped forward to make obeisanceto Richard was a young man of low stature and slight form.His dress was as modest as his figure was unimpressive; buthe bore on his bonnet a gold buckle, with a gem, the lustreof which could only be rivalled by the brilliancy of the eyewhich the bonnet shaded. It was the only striking feature in 286The Talismanhis countenance; but when once noticed, it ever made a strongimpression on the spectator. About his neck there hung in ascarf of sky-blue silk a wrest as it was called?that is, the keywith which a harp is tuned, and which was of solid gold.This personage would have kneeled reverently to Richard,but the Monarch raised him in joyful haste, pressed him tohis bosom warmly, and kissed him on either side of the face.?Blondel de Nesle!? he exclaimed joyfully??welcome fromCyprus, my king of minstrels!?welcome to the King of En-gland, who rates not his own dignity more highly than hedoes thine. I have been sick, man, and, by my soul, I believe itwas for lack of thee; for, were I half way to the gate of heaven,methinks thy strains could call me back. And what news, mygentle master, from the land of the lyre? Anything fresh fromthe Trouveurs of Provence? Anything from the minstrels ofmerry Normandy? Above all, hast thou thyself been busy? ButI need not ask thee?thou canst not be idle if thou wouldst;thy noble qualities are like a fire burning within, and compelthee to pour thyself out in music and song.??Something I have learned, and something I have done,noble King,? answered the celebrated Blondel, with a retir-ing modesty which all Richard?s enthusiastic admiration ofhis skill had been unable to banish.?We will hear thee, man?we will hear thee instantly,? saidthe King. Then, touching Blondel?s shoulder kindly, he added,?That is, if thou art not fatigued with thy journey; for I wouldsooner ride my best horse to death than injure a note of thyvoice.??My voice is, as ever, at the service of my royal patron,?said Blondel; ?but your Majesty,? he added, looking at somepapers on the table, ?seems more importantly engaged, andthe hour waxes late.??Not a whit, man, not a whit, my dearest Blondel. I didbut sketch an array of battle against the Saracens, a thing ofa moment, almost as soon done as the routing of them.??Methinks, however,? said Thomas de Vaux, ?it were notunfit to inquire what soldiers your Grace hath to array. Ibring reports on that subject from Ascalon.??Thou art a mule, Thomas,? said the King??a very mulefor dullness and obstinacy!  Come, nobles?a hall?a hall?range ye around him! Give Blondel the tabouret. Where ishis harp-bearer??or, soft, lend him my harp, his own may 287Sir Walter Scottbe damaged by the journey.??I would your Grace would take my report,? said Thomasde Vaux. ?I have ridden far, and have more list to my bedthan to have my ears tickled.??They ears tickled!? said the King; ?that must be with awoodcock?s feather, and not with sweet sounds. Hark thee,Thomas, do thine ears know the singing of Blondel from thebraying of an ass???In faith, my liege,? replied Thomas, ?I cannot well say;but setting Blondel out of the question, who is a born gentle-man, and doubtless of high acquirements, I shall never, forthe sake of your Grace?s question, look on a minstrel but Ishall think upon an ass.??And might not your manners,? said Richard, ?have ex-cepted me, who am a gentleman born as well as Blondel,and, like him, a guild-brother of the joyeuse science???Your Grace should remember,? said De Vaux, smiling,?that ?tis useless asking for manners from a mule.??Most truly spoken,? said the King; ?and an ill-conditionedanimal thou art. But come hither, master mule, and be un-loaded, that thou mayest get thee to thy litter, without anymusic being wasted on thee. Meantime do thou, good brotherof Salisbury, go to our consort?s tent, and tell her that Blondelhas arrived, with his budget fraught with the newest minstrelsy.Bid her come hither instantly, and do thou escort her, and seethat our cousin, Edith Plantagenet, remain not behind.?His eye then rested for a moment on the Nubian, withthat expression of doubtful meaning which his countenanceusually displayed when he looked at him.?Ha, our silent and secret messenger returned??Stand up,slave, behind the back of De Neville, and thou shalt hearpresently sounds which will make thee bless God that Heafflicted thee rather with dumbness than deafness.?So saying, he turned from the rest of the company towardsDe Vaux, and plunged instantly into the military details whichthat baron laid before him.About the time that the Lord of Gilsland had finished hisaudience, a messenger announced that the Queen and herattendants were approaching the royal tent.??A flask ofwine, ho!? said the King; ?of old King Isaac?s long-savedCyprus, which we won when we stormed Famagosta. Fill tothe stout Lord of Gilsland, gentles?a more careful and faith- 288The Talismanful servant never had any prince.??I am glad,? said Thomas de Vaux, ?that your Grace findsthe mule a useful slave, though his voice be less musical thanhorse-hair or wire.??What, thou canst not yet digest that quip of the mule??said Richard. ?Wash it down with a brimming flagon, man,or thou wilt choke upon it. Why, so?well pulled!?and nowI will tell thee, thou art a soldier as well as I, and we mustbrook each other?s jests in the hall as each other?s blows inthe tourney, and love each other the harder we hit. By myfaith, if thou didst not hit me as hard as I did thee in our lateencounter! thou gavest all thy wit to the thrust. But here liesthe difference betwixt thee and Blondel. Thou art but mycomrade?I might say my pupil?in the art of war; Blondelis my master in the science of minstrelsy and music. To theeI permit the freedom of intimacy; to him I must do rever-ence, as to my superior in his art. Come, man, be not pee-vish, but remain and hear our glee.??To see your Majesty in such cheerful mood,? said the Lordof Gilsland, ?by my faith, I could remain till Blondel hadachieved the great romance of King Arthur, which lasts forthree days.??We will not tax your patience so deeply,? said the King.?But see, yonder glare of torches without shows that our con-sort approaches. Away to receive her, man, and win thyselfgrace in the brightest eyes of Christendom. Nay, never stopto adjust thy cloak. See, thou hast let Neville come betweenthe wind and the sails of thy galley.??He was never before me in the field of battle,? said DeVaux, not greatly pleased to see himself anticipated by themore active service of the chamberlain.?No, neither he nor any one went before thee there, mygood Tom of the Gills,? said the King, ?unless it was ourself,now and then.??Ay, my liege,? said De Vaux, ?and let us do justice to theunfortunate. The unhappy Knight of the Leopard hath beenbefore me too, at a season; for, look you, he weighs less onhorseback, and so???Hush!? said the King, interrupting him in a peremptorytone, ?not a word of him,? and instantly stepped forward togreet his royal consort; and when he had done so, he pre-sented to her Blondel, as king of minstrelsy and his master 289Sir Walter Scottin the gay science. Berengaria, who well knew that her royalhusband?s passion for poetry and music almost equalled hisappetite for warlike fame, and that Blondel was his especialfavourite, took anxious care to receive him with all the flat-tering distinctions due to one whom the King delighted tohonour. Yet it was evident that, though Blondel made suit-able returns to the compliments showered on him somethingtoo abundantly by the royal beauty, he owned with deeperreverence and more humble gratitude the simple and grace-ful welcome of Edith, whose kindly greeting appeared to him,perhaps, sincere in proportion to its brevity and simplicity.Both the Queen and her royal husband were aware of thisdistinction, and Richard, seeing his consort somewhat piquedat the preference assigned to his cousin, by which perhaps hehimself did not feel much gratified, said in the hearing ofboth, ?We minstrels, Berengaria, as thou mayest see by thebearing of our master Blondel, pay more reverence to a se-vere judge like our kinswoman than to a kindly, partial friendlike thyself, who is willing to take our worth upon trust.?Edith was moved by this sarcasm of her royal kinsman,and hesitated not to reply that, ?To be a harsh and severejudge was not an attribute proper to her alone of all thePlantagenets.?She had perhaps said more, having some touch of the tem-per of that house, which, deriving their name and cognizancefrom the lowly broom (Planta genista), assumed as an emblemof humility, were perhaps one of the proudest families thatever ruled in England; but her eye, when kindling in her reply,suddenly caught those of the Nubian, although he endeav-oured to conceal himself behind the nobles who were present,and she sunk upon a seat, turning so pale that Queen Berengariadeemed herself obliged to call for water and essences, and togo through the other ceremonies appropriate to a lady?s swoon.Richard, who better estimated Edith?s strength of mind, calledto Blondel to assume his seat and commence his lay, declaringthat minstrelsy was worth every other recipe to recall aPlantagenet to life. ?Sing us,? he said, ?that song of the BloodyVest, of which thou didst formerly give me the argument ere Ileft Cyprus. Thou must be perfect in it by this time, or, as ouryeomen say, thy bow is broken.?The anxious eye of the minstrel, however, dwelt on Edith,and it was not till he observed her returning colour that he 290The Talismanobeyed the repeated commands of the King. Then, accom-panying his voice with the harp, so as to grace, but yet notdrown, the sense of what he sung, he chanted in a sort ofrecitative one of those ancient adventures of love and knight-hood which were wont of yore to win the public attention.So soon as he began to prelude, the insignificance of his per-sonal appearance seemed to disappear, and his countenanceglowed with energy and inspiration. His full, manly, mellowvoice, so absolutely under command of the purest taste,thrilled on every ear and to every heart. Richard, rejoiced asafter victory, called out the appropriate summons for silence,?Listen, lords, in bower and hall;?while, with the zeal of a patron at once and a pupil, hearranged the circle around, and hushed them into silence;and he himself sat down with an air of expectation and in-terest, not altogether unmixed with the gravity of the pro-fessed critic. The courtiers turned their eyes on the King,that they might be ready to trace and imitate the emotionshis features should express, and Thomas de Vaux yawnedtremendously, as one who submitted unwillingly to a weari-some penance. The song of Blondel was of course in theNorman language, but the verses which follow express itsmeaning and its manner. 291Sir Walter ScottTHE BLOODY VEST.?Twas near the fair city of Benevent,When the sun was setting on bough and bent,And knights were preparing in bower and tent,On the eve of the Baptist?s tournament;When in Lincoln green a stripling gent,Well seeming a page by a princess sent,Wander?d the camp, and, still as he went,Inquired for the Englishman, Thomas a Kent.Far hath he far?d, and farther must fare,Till he finds his pavilion nor stately nor rare,?Little save iron and steel was there;And, as lacking the coin to pay armourer?s care,With his sinewy arms to the shoulders bare,The good knight with hammer and file did repairThe mail that to-morrow must see him wear,For the honour of Saint John and his lady fair.?Thus speaks my lady,? the page said he,And the knight bent lowly both head and knee,?She is Benevent?s Princess so high in degree,And thou art as lowly as knight may well be?He that would climb so lofty a tree,Or spring such a gulf as divides her from thee,Must dare some high deed, by which all men may seeHis ambition is back?d by his hie chivalrie.?Therefore thus speaks my lady,? the fair page he said,And the knight lowly louted with hand and with head,?Fling aside the good armour in which thou art clad,And don thou this weed of her night-gear instead,For a hauberk of steel, a kirtle of thread;And charge, thus attir?d, in the tournament dread,And fight as thy wont is where most blood is shed,And bring honour away, or remain with the dead.?Untroubled in his look, and untroubled in his breast,The knight the weed hath taken, and reverently hath kiss?d.?Now blessed be the moment, the messenger be blest! 292The TalismanMuch honour?d do I hold me in my lady?s high behest;And say unto my lady, in this dear night-weed dress?d,To the best armed champion I will not veil my crest;But if I live and bear me well ?tis her turn to take the test.?HERE, GENTLES, ends the foremost fytte of the Lay of theBloody Vest.?Thou hast changed the measure upon us unawares in thatlast couplet, my Blondel,? said the King.?Most true, my lord,? said Blondel. ?I rendered the versesfrom the Italian of an old harper whom I met in Cyprus, andnot having had time either to translate it accurately or com-mit it to memory, I am fain to supply gaps in the music andthe verse as I can upon the spur of the moment, as you seeboors mend a quickset fence with a fagot.??Nay, on my faith,? said the King, ?I like these rattling,rolling Alexandrines. Methinks they come more twanginglyoff to the music than that briefer measure.??Both are licensed, as is well known to your Grace,? an-swered Blondel.?They are so, Blondel,? said Richard, ?yet methinks thescene where there is like to be fighting will go best on inthese same thundering Alexandrines, which sound like thecharge of cavalry, while the other measure is but like thesidelong amble of a lady?s palfrey.??It shall be as your Grace pleases,? replied Blondel, andbegan again to prelude.?Nay, first cherish thy fancy with a cup of fiery Chios wine,?said the King. ?And hark thee, I would have thee fling awaythat new-fangled restriction of thine, of terminating in ac-curate and similar rhymes. They are a constraint on thy flowof fancy, and make thee resemble a man dancing in fetters.??The fetters are easily flung off, at least,? said Blondel, againsweeping his fingers over the strings, as one who would ratherhave played than listened to criticism.?But why put them on, man?? continued the King.?Wherefore thrust thy genius into iron bracelets? I marvelhow you got forward at all. I am sure I should not have beenable to compose a stanza in yonder hampered measure.?Blondel looked down, and busied himself with the stringsof his harp, to hide an involuntary smile which crept overhis features; but it escaped not Richard?s observation. 293Sir Walter Scott?By my faith, thou laughest at me, Blondel,? he said; ?and,in good truth, every man deserves it who presumes to playthe master when he should be the pupil. But we kings getbad habits of self-opinion. Come, on with thy lay, dearestBlondel?on after thine own fashion, better than aught thatwe can suggest, though we must needs be talking.?Blondel resumed the lay; but as extemporaneous composi-tion was familiar to him, he failed not to comply with theKing?s hints, and was perhaps not displeased to show withhow much ease he could new-model a poem, even while inthe act of recitation.THE BLOODY VEST.FYTTE SECOND.The Baptist?s fair morrow beheld gallant feats?There was winning of honour and losing of seats;There was hewing with falchions and splintering of staves?The victors won glory, the vanquish?d won graves.Oh, many a knight there fought bravely and well,Yet one was accounted his peers to excel,And ?twas he whose sole armour on body and breastSeem?d the weed of a damsel when bouned for her rest.There were some dealt him wounds that were bloody and sore,But others respected his plight, and forbore.?It is some oath of honour,? they said, ?and I trow,?Twere unknightly to slay him achieving his vow.?Then the Prince, for his sake, bade the tournament cease?He flung down his warder, the trumpets sung peace;And the judges declare, and competitors yield,That the Knight of the Night-gear was first in the field. 294The TalismanThe feast it was nigh, and the mass it was nigher,When before the fair Princess low looted a squire,And deliver?d a garment unseemly to view,With sword-cut and spear-thrust, all hack?d and pierc?dthrough;All rent and all tatter?d, all clotted with blood,With foam of the horses, with dust, and with mud;Not the point of that lady?s small finger, I ween,Could have rested on spot was unsullied and clean.?This token my master, Sir Thomas a Kent,Restores to the Princess of fair Benevent;He that climbs the tall tree has won right to the fruit,He that leaps the wide gulf should prevail in his suit;Through life?s utmost peril the prize I have won,And now must the faith of my mistress be shown:For she who prompts knights on such danger to runMust avouch his true service in front of the sun.??I restore,? says my master, ?the garment I?ve worn,And I claim of the Princess to don it in turn;For its stains and its rents she should prize it the more,Since by shame ?tis unsullied, though crimson?d with gore.??Then deep blush?d the Princess?yet kiss?d she and press?dThe blood-spotted robes to her lips and her breast.?Go tell my true knight, church and chamber shall showIf I value the blood on this garment or no.?And when it was time for the nobles to pass,In solemn procession to minster and mass,The first walk?d the Princess in purple and pall,But the blood-besmear?d night-robe she wore over all;And eke, in the hall, where they all sat at dine,When she knelt to her father and proffer?d the wine,Over all her rich robes and state jewels she woreThat wimple unseemly bedabbled with gore.Then lords whisper?d ladies, as well you may think,And ladies replied with nod, titter, and wink;And the Prince, who in anger and shame had look?d down, 295Sir Walter ScottTurn?d at length to his daughter, and spoke with a frown:?Now since thou hast publish?d thy folly and guilt,E?en atone with thy hand for the blood thou hast spilt;Yet sore for your boldness you both will repent,When you wander as exiles from fair Benevent??Then out spoke stout Thomas, in hall where he stood,Exhausted and feeble, but dauntless of mood:?The blood that I lost for this daughter of thine,I pour?d forth as freely as flask gives its wine;And if for my sake she brooks penance and blame,Do not doubt I will save her from suffering and shame;And light will she reck of thy princedom and rent,When I hail her, in England, the Countess of Kent,?A MURMUR OF APPLAUSE ran through the assembly, followingthe example of Richard himself, who loaded with praises hisfavourite minstrel, and ended by presenting him with a ringof considerable value. The Queen hastened to distinguishthe favourite by a rich bracelet, and many of the nobles whowere present followed the royal example.?Is our cousin Edith,? said the King, ?become insensibleto the sound of the harp she once loved???She thanks Blondel for his lay,? replied Edith, ?but dou-bly the kindness of the kinsman who suggested it.??Thou art angry, cousin,? said the King; ?angry becausethou hast heard of a woman more wayward than thyself. Butyou escape me not. I will walk a space homeward with youtowards the Queen?s pavilion. We must have conference to-gether ere the night has waned into morning.?The Queen and her attendants were now on foot, and theother guests withdrew from the royal tent. A train with blaz-ing torches, and an escort of archers, awaited Berengaria with-out the pavilion, and she was soon on her way homeward.Richard, as he had proposed, walked beside his kinswoman,and compelled her to accept of his arm as her support, sothat they could speak to each other without being overheard.What answer, then, am I to return to the noble Soldan??said Richard. ?The kings and princes are falling from me,Edith; this new quarrel hath alienated them once more. Iwould do something for the Holy Sepulchre by composi-tion, if not by victory; and the chance of my doing this de- 296The Talismanpends, alas, on the caprice of a woman. I would lay my singlespear in the rest against ten of the best lances in Christendom,rather than argue with a wilful wench who knows not whatis for her own good. What answer, coz, am I to return to theSoldan? It must be decisive.??Tell him,? said Edith, ?that the poorest of the Plantagenetswill rather wed with misery than with misbelief.??Shall I say with slavery, Edith?? said the King. ?Methinksthat is nearer thy thoughts.??There is no room,? said Edith, ?for the suspicion you sogrossly insinuate. Slavery of the body might have been pit-ied, but that of the soul is only to be despised. Shame tothee, King of merry England. Thou hast enthralled both thelimbs and the spirit of a knight, one scarce less famed thanthyself.??Should I not prevent my kinswoman from drinking poi-son, by sullying the vessel which contained it, if I saw noother means of disgusting her with the fatal liquor?? repliedthe King.?It is thyself,? answered Edith, ?that would press me todrink poison, because it is proffered in a golden chalice.??Edith,? said Richard, ?I cannot force thy resolution; butbeware you shut not the door which Heaven opens. The her-mit of Engaddi?he whom Popes and Councils have regardedas a prophet?hath read in the stars that thy marriage shallreconcile me with a powerful enemy, and that thy husbandshall be Christian, leaving thus the fairest ground to hope thatthe conversion of the Soldan, and the bringing in of the sonsof Ishmael to the pale of the church, will be the consequenceof thy wedding with Saladin. Come, thou must make somesacrifice rather than mar such happy prospects.??Men may sacrifice rams and goats,? said Edith, ?but nothonour and conscience. I have heard that it was the dishonourof a Christian maiden which brought the Saracens into Spain;the shame of another is no likely mode of expelling themfrom Palestine.??Dost thou call it shame to become an empress?? said theKing.?I call it shame and dishonour to profane a Christian sac-rament by entering into it with an infidel whom it cannotbind; and I call it foul dishonour that I, the descendant of aChristian princess, should become of free will the head of a 297Sir Walter Scottharam of heathen concubines.??Well, kinswoman,? said the King, after a pause, ?I mustnot quarrel with thee, though I think thy dependent condi-tion might have dictated more compliance.??My liege,? replied Edith, ?your Grace hath worthily suc-ceeded to all the wealth, dignity, and dominion of the Houseof Plantagenet?do not, therefore, begrudge your poor kins-woman some small share of their pride.??By my faith, wench,? said the King, ?thou hast unhorsedme with that very word, so we will kiss and be friends. I willpresently dispatch thy answer to Saladin. But after all, coz,were it not better to suspend your answer till you have seenhim? Men say he is pre-eminently handsome.??There is no chance of our meeting, my lord,? said Edith.?By Saint George, but there is next to a certainty of it,?said the King; ?for Saladin will doubtless afford us a freefield for the doing of this new battle of the Standard, andwill witness it himself. Berengaria is wild to behold it also;and I dare be sworn not a feather of you, her companionsand attendants, will remain behind?least of all thou thy-self, fair coz. But come, we have reached the pavilion, andmust part; not in unkindness thou, oh?nay, thou must sealit with thy lip as well as thy hand, sweet Edith?it is myright as a sovereign to kiss my pretty vassals.?He embraced her respectfully and affectionately, and re-turned through the moonlit camp, humming to himself suchsnatches of Blondel?s lay as he could recollect.On his arrival he lost no time in making up his dispatchesfor Saladin, and delivered them to the Nubian, with a chargeto set out by peep of day on his return to the Soldan. 298The TalismanCHAPTER XXVII.We heard the Tecbir?so these Arabs callTheir shout of onset, when, with loud acclaim,They challenge Heaven to give them victory.Siege of Damascus.ON THE SUBSEQUENT MORNING Richard was invited to a con-ference by Philip of France, in which the latter, with manyexpressions of his high esteem for his brother of England,communicated to him in terms extremely courteous, but tooexplicit to be misunderstood, his positive intention to returnto Europe, and to the cares of his kingdom, as entirely de-spairing of future success in their undertaking, with theirdiminished forces and civil discords. Richard remonstrated,but in vain; and when the conference ended he received with-out surprise a manifesto from the Duke of Austria, and sev-eral other princes, announcing a resolution similar to that ofPhilip, and in no modified terms, assigning, for their defec-tion from the cause of the Cross, the inordinate ambitionand arbitrary domination of Richard of England. All hopesof continuing the war with any prospect of ultimate successwere now abandoned; and Richard, while he shed bitter tearsover his disappointed hopes of glory, was little consoled bythe recollection that the failure was in some degree to beimputed to the advantages which he had given his enemiesby his own hasty and imprudent temper.?They had not dared to have deserted my father thus,? hesaid to De Vaux, in the bitterness of his resentment. ?Noslanders they could have uttered against so wise a king wouldhave been believed in Christendom; whereas?fool that Iam!?I have not only afforded them a pretext for desertingme, but even a colour for casting all the blame of the ruptureupon my unhappy foibles.?These thoughts were so deeply galling to the King, thatDe Vaux was rejoiced when the arrival of an ambassador fromSaladin turned his reflections into a different channel.This new envoy was an Emir much respected by the Soldan,whose name was Abdallah el Hadgi. He derived his descentfrom the family of the Prophet, and the race or tribe ofHashem, in witness of which genealogy he wore a green tur- 299Sir Walter Scottban of large dimensions. He had also three times performedthe journey to Mecca, from which he derived his epithet ofEl Hadgi, or the Pilgrim. Notwithstanding these various pre-tensions to sanctity, Abdallah was (for an Arab) a boon com-panion, who enjoyed a merry tale, and laid aside his gravityso far as to quaff a blithe flagon when secrecy ensured himagainst scandal. He was likewise a statesman, whose abilitieshad been used by Saladin in various negotiations with theChristian princes, and particularly with Richard, to whomEl Hadgi was personally known and acceptable. Animatedby the cheerful acquiescence with which the envoy of Saladinafforded a fair field for the combat, a safe conduct for allwho might choose to witness it, and offered his own personas a guarantee of his fidelity, Richard soon forgot his disap-pointed hopes, and the approaching dissolution of the Chris-tian league, in the interesting discussions preceding a com-bat in the lists.The station called the Diamond of the Desert was assignedfor the place of conflict, as being nearly at an equal distancebetwixt the Christian and Saracen camps. It was agreed thatConrade of Montserrat, the defendant, with his godfathers,the Archduke of Austria and the Grand Master of theTemplars, should appear there on the day fixed for the com-bat, with a hundred armed followers, and no more; that Ri-chard of England and his brother Salisbury, who supportedthe accusation, should attend with the same number, to pro-tect his champion; and that the Soldan should bring withhim a guard of five hundred chosen followers, a band con-sidered as not more than equal to the two hundred Christianlances. Such persons of consideration as either party choseto invite to witness the contest were to wear no other weap-ons than their swords, and to come without defensive armour.The Soldan undertook the preparation of the lists, and toprovide accommodations and refreshments of every kind forall who were to assist at the solemnity; and his letters ex-pressed with much courtesy the pleasure which he antici-pated in the prospect of a personal and peaceful meetingwith the Melech Ric, and his anxious desire to render hisreception as agreeable as possible.All preliminaries being arranged and communicated to thedefendant and his godfathers, Abdullah the Hadgi was ad-mitted to a more private interview, where he heard with de- 300The Talismanlight the strains of Blondel. Having first carefully put hisgreen turban out of sight, and assumed a Greek cap in itsstead, he requited the Norman minstrel?s music with a drink-ing song from the Persian, and quaffed a hearty flagon ofCyprus wine, to show that his practice matched his prin-ciples. On the next day, grave and sober as the water-drinkerMirglip, he bent his brow to the ground before Saladin?s foot-stool, and rendered to the Soldan an account of his embassy.On the day before that appointed for the combat Conradeand his friends set off by daybreak to repair to the place as-signed, and Richard left the camp at the same hour and forthe same purpose; but, as had been agreed upon, he took hisjourney by a different route?a precaution which had beenjudged necessary, to prevent the possibility of a quarrel be-twixt their armed attendants.The good King himself was in no humour for quarrellingwith any one. Nothing could have added to his pleasurableanticipations of a desperate and bloody combat in the lists,except his being in his own royal person one of the combat-ants; and he was half in charity again even with Conrade ofMontserrat. Lightly armed, richly dressed, and gay as a bride-groom on the eve of his nuptials, Richard caracoled along bythe side of Queen Berengaria?s litter, Pointing out to her thevarious scenes through which they passed, and cheering withtale and song the bosom of the inhospitable wilderness. Theformer route of the Queen?s pilgrimage to Engaddi had beenon the other side of the chain of mountains, so that the la-dies were strangers to the scenery of the desert; and thoughBerengaria knew her husband?s disposition too well not toendeavour to seem interested in what he was pleased eitherto say or to sing, she could not help indulging some femalefears when she found herself in the howling wilderness withso small an escort, which seemed almost like a moving speckon the bosom of the plain, and knew at the same time theywere not so distant from the camp of Saladin, but what theymight be in a moment surprised and swept off by an over-powering host of his fiery-footed cavalry, should the paganbe faithless enough to embrace an opportunity thus tempt-ing. But when she hinted these suspicions to Richard he re-pelled them with displeasure and disdain. ?It were worse thaningratitude,? he said, ?to doubt the good faith of the gener-ous Soldan.? 301Sir Walter ScottYet the same doubts and fears recurred more than once,not to the timid mind of the Queen alone, but to the firmerand more candid soul of Edith Plantagenet, who had no suchconfidence in the faith of the Moslem as to render her per-fectly at ease when so much in their power; and her surprisehad been far less than her terror, if the desert around hadsuddenly resounded with the shout of Allah hu! and a bandof Arab cavalry had pounced on them like vultures on theirprey. Nor were these suspicions lessened when, as eveningapproached, they were aware of a single Arab horseman, dis-tinguished by his turban and long lance, hovering on theedge of a small eminence like a hawk poised in the air, andwho instantly, on the appearance of the royal retinue, dartedoff with the speed of the same bird when it shoots down thewind and disappears from the horizon.?We must be near the station,? said King Richard; ?andyonder cavalier is one of Saladin?s outposts?methinks I hearthe noise of the Moorish horns and cymbals. Get you intoorder, my hearts, and form yourselves around the ladiessoldierlike and firmly.?As he spoke, each knight, squire, and archer hastily closedin upon his appointed ground, and they proceeded in themost compact order, which made their numbers appear stillsmaller. And to say the truth, though there might be no fear,there was anxiety as well as curiosity in the attention withwhich they listened to the wild bursts of Moorish music,which came ever and anon more distinctly from the quarterin which the Arab horseman had been seen to disappear.De Vaux spoke in a whisper to the King. ?Were it not well,my liege, to send a page to the top of that sand-bank? Orwould it stand with your pleasure that I prick forward?Methinks, by all yonder clash and clang, if there be no morethan five hundred men beyond the sand-hills, half of theSoldan?s retinue must be drummers and cymbal-tossers. ShallI spur on??The baron had checked his horse with the bit, and wasjust about to strike him with the spurs when the King ex-claimed, ?Not for the world. Such a caution would expresssuspicion, and could do little to prevent surprise, which,however, I apprehend not.?They advanced accordingly in close and firm order till theysurmounted the line of low sand-hills, and came in sight of 302The Talismanthe appointed station, when a splendid, but at the same timea startling, spectacle awaited them.The Diamond of the Desert, so lately a solitary fountain,distinguished only amid the waste by solitary groups of palm-trees, was now the centre of an encampment, the embroi-dered flags and gilded ornaments of which glittered far andwide, and reflected a thousand rich tints against the settingsun. The coverings of the large pavilions were of the gayestcolours?scarlet, bright yellow, pale blue, and other gaudyand gleaming hues?and the tops of their pillars, or tent-poles, were decorated with golden pomegranates and smallsilken flags. But besides these distinguished pavilions, therewere what Thomas de Vaux considered as a portentous num-ber of the ordinary black tents of the Arabs, being sufficient,as he conceived, to accommodate, according to the Easternfashion, a host of five thousand men. A number of Arabs andKurds, fully corresponding to the extent of the encampment,were hastily assembling, each leading his horse in his hand,and their muster was accompanied by an astonishing clamourof their noisy instruments of martial music, by which, in allages, the warfare of the Arabs has been animated.They soon formed a deep and confused mass of dismountedcavalry in front of their encampment, when, at the signal ofa shrill cry, which arose high over the clangour of the music,each cavalier sprung to his saddle. A cloud of dust arising atthe moment of this manoeuvre hid from Richard and hisattendants the camp, the palm-trees, and the distant ridge ofmountains, as well as the troops whose sudden movementhad raised the cloud, and, ascending high over their heads,formed itself into the fantastic forms of writhed pillars, domes,and minarets. Another shrill yell was heard from the bosomof this cloudy tabernacle. It was the signal for the cavalry toadvance, which they did at full gallop, disposing themselvesas they came forward so as to come in at once on the front,flanks, and rear of Richard?s little bodyguard, who were thussurrounded, and almost choked by the dense clouds of dustenveloping them on each side, through which were seen al-ternately, and lost, the grim forms and wild faces of theSaracens, brandishing and tossing their lances in every pos-sible direction with the wildest cries and halloos, and fre-quently only reining up their horses when within a spear?slength of the Christians, while those in the rear discharged 303Sir Walter Scottover the heads of both parties thick volleys of arrows. One ofthese struck the litter in which the Queen was seated, wholoudly screamed, and the red spot was on Richard?s brow inan instant.?Ha! Saint George,? he exclaimed, ?we must take someorder with this infidel scum!?But Edith, whose litter was near, thrust her head out, andwith her hand holding one of the shafts, exclaimed, ?RoyalRichard, beware what you do! see, these arrows are headless!??Noble, sensible wench!? exclaimed Richard; ?by Heaven,thou shamest us all by thy readiness of thought and eye.?Be not moved, my English hearts,? he exclaimed to his fol-lowers; ?their arrows have no heads?and their spears, too,lack the steel points. It is but a wild welcome, after theirsavage fashion, though doubtless they would rejoice to seeus daunted or disturbed. Move onward, slow and steady.?The little phalanx moved forward accordingly, accompa-nied on all sides by the Arabs, with the shrillest and mostpiercing cries, the bowmen, meanwhile, displaying their agil-ity by shooting as near the crests of the Christians as waspossible, without actually hitting them, while the lancerscharged each other with such rude blows of their blunt weap-ons that more than one of them lost his saddle, and well-nigh his life, in this rough sport. All this, though designed toexpress welcome, had rather a doubtful appearance in theeyes of the Europeans.As they had advanced nearly half way towards the camp,King Richard and his suite forming, as it were, the nucleusround which this tumultuary body of horsemen howled,whooped, skirmished, and galloped, creating a scene of in-describable confusion, another shrill cry was heard, on whichall these irregulars, who were on the front and upon the flanksof the little body of Europeans, wheeled off; and formingthemselves into a long and deep column, followed with com-parative order and silence in the rear of Richard?s troops.The dust began now to dissipate in their front, when thereadvanced to meet them through that cloudy veil a body ofcavalry of a different and more regular description, completelyarmed with offensive and defensive weapons, and who mightwell have served as a bodyguard to the proudest of Easternmonarchs. This splendid troop consisted of five hundred menand each horse which it contained was worth an earl?s ran- 304The Talismansom. The riders were Georgian and Circassian slaves in thevery prime of life. Their helmets and hauberks were formedof steel rings, so bright that they shone like silver; their ves-tures were of the gayest colours, and some of cloth of gold orsilver; the sashes were twisted with silk and gold, their richturbans were plumed and jewelled, and their sabres and pon-iards, of Damascene steel, were adorned with gold and gemson hilt and scabbard.This splendid array advanced to the sound of military mu-sic, and when they met the Christian body they opened theirfiles to the right and left, and let them enter between theirranks. Richard now assumed the foremost place in his troop,aware that Saladin himself was approaching. Nor was it longwhen, in the centre of his bodyguard, surrounded by hisdomestic officers and those hideous negroes who guard theEastern haram, and whose misshapen forms were renderedyet more frightful by the richness of their attire, came theSoldan, with the look and manners of one on whose browNature had written, This is a King! In his snow-white tur-ban, vest, and wide Eastern trousers, wearing a sash of scar-let silk, without any other ornament, Saladin might haveseemed the plainest-dressed man in his own guard. But closerinspection discerned in his turban that inestimable gem whichwas called by the poets the Sea of Light; the diamond onwhich his signet was engraved, and which he wore in a ring,was probably worth all the jewels of the English crown; anda sapphire which terminated the hilt of his cangiar was notof much inferior value. It should be added that, to Protecthimself from the dust, which in the vicinity of the Dead Searesembles the finest ashes, or, perhaps, out of Oriental pride,the Soldan wore a sort of veil attached to his turban, whichpartly obscured the view of his noble features. He rode amilk-white Arabian, which bore him as if conscious andproud of his noble burden.There was no need of further introduction. The two he-roic monarchs?for such they both were?threw them selvesat once from horseback, and the troops halting and the mu-sic suddenly ceasing, they advanced to meet each other inprofound silence, and after a courteous inclination on eitherside they embraced as brethren and equals. The pomp anddisplay upon both sides attracted no further notice?no onesaw aught save Richard and Saladin, and they too beheld 305Sir Walter Scottnothing but each other. The looks with which Richard sur-veyed Saladin were, however, more intently curious than thosewhich the Soldan fixed upon him; and the Soldan also wasthe first to break silence.?The Melech Ric is welcome to Saladin as water to thisdesert. I trust he hath no distrust of this numerous array.Excepting the armed slaves of my household, those who sur-round you with eyes of wonder and of welcome are?eventhe humblest of them?the privileged nobles of my thou-sand tribes; for who that could claim a title to be presentwould remain at home when such a Prince was to be seen asRichard, with the terrors of whose name, even on the sandsof Yemen, the nurse stills her child, and the free Arab sub-dues his restive steed!??And these are all nobles of Araby?? said Richard, lookingaround on wild forms with their persons covered with haiks,their countenance swart with the sunbeams, their teeth aswhite as ivory, their black eyes glancing with fierce and pre-ternatural lustre from under the shade of their turbans, andtheir dress being in general simple even to meanness.?They claim such rank,? said Saladin; ?but though nu-merous, they are within the conditions of the treaty, andbear no arms but the sabre?even the iron of their lances isleft behind.??I fear,? muttered De Vaux in English, ?they have left themwhere they can be soon found a most flourishing House ofPeers, I confess, and would find Westminster Hall some-thing too narrow for them.??Hush, De Vaux,? said Richard, ?I command thee.?NobleSaladin,? he said, ?suspicion and thou cannot exist on thesame ground. Seest thou,? pointing to the litters, ?I too havebrought some champions with me, though armed, perhaps,in breach of agreement; for bright eyes and fair features areweapons which cannot be left behind.?The Soldan, turning to the litters, made an obeisance aslowly as if looking towards Mecca, and kissed the sand intoken of respect.?Nay,? said Richard, ?they will not fear a closer encounter,brother; wilt thou not ride towards their litters, and the cur-tains will be presently withdrawn?? ?That may Allah pro-hibit!? said Saladin, ?since not an Arab looks on who wouldnot think it shame to the noble ladies to be seen with their 306The Talismanfaces uncovered.??Thou shalt see them, then, in private, brother,? answeredRichard.?To what purpose?? answered Saladin mournfully. ?Thylast letter was, to the hopes which I had entertained, likewater to fire; and wherefore should I again light a flame whichmay indeed consume, but cannot cheer me? But will not mybrother pass to the tent which his servant hath prepared forhim? My principal black slave hath taken order for the re-ception of the Princesses, the officers of my household willattend your followers, and ourself will be the chamberlain ofthe royal Richard.?He led the way accordingly to a splendid pavilion, wherewas everything that royal luxury could devise. De Vaux, whowas in attendance, then removed the chappe (capa), or longriding-cloak, which Richard wore, and he stood beforeSaladin in the close dress which showed to advantage thestrength and symmetry of his person, while it bore a strongcontrast to the flowing robes which disguised the thin frame.of the Eastern monarch. It was Richard?s two-handed swordthat chiefly attracted the attention of the Saracen?a broad,straight blade, the seemingly unwieldy length of which ex-tended well-nigh from the shoulder to the heel of the wearer.?Had I not,? said Saladin, ?seen this brand flaming in thefront of battle, like that of Azrael, I had scarce believed thathuman arm could wield it. Might I request to see the MelechRic strike one blow with it in peace, and in pure trial ofstrength???Willingly, noble Saladin,? answered Richard; and look-ing around for something whereon to exercise his strength,he saw a steel mace held by one of the attendants, the handlebeing of the same metal, and about an inch and a half indiameter. This he placed on a block of wood.The anxiety of De Vaux for his master?s honour led him towhisper in English, ?For the blessed Virgin?s sake, bewarewhat you attempt, my liege! Your full strength is not as yetreturned?give no triumph to the infidel.??Peace, fool!? said Richard, standing firm on his ground,and casting a fierce glance around; ?thinkest thou that I canfail in his presence??The glittering broadsword, wielded by both his hands, rosealoft to the King?s left shoulder, circled round his head, de- 307Sir Walter Scottscended with the sway of some terrific engine, and the bar ofiron rolled on the ground in two pieces, as a woodsman wouldsever a sapling with a hedging-bill.?By the head of the Prophet, a most wonderful blow!? saidthe Soldan, critically and accurately examining the iron barwhich had been cut asunder; and the blade of the sword wasso well tempered as to exhibit not the least token of havingsuffered by the feat it had performed. He then took the King?shand, and looking on the size and muscular strength whichit exhibited, laughed as he placed it beside his own, so lankand thin, so inferior in brawn and sinew.?Ay, look well,? said De Vaux in English, ?it will be longere your long jackanape?s fingers do such a feat with yourfine gilded reaping-hook there.??Silence, De Vaux,? said Richard;?by Our Lady, he under-stands or guesses thy meaning?be not so broad, I pray thee.?The Soldan, indeed, presently said, ?Something I wouldfain attempt?though wherefore should the weak show theirinferiority in presence of the strong? Yet each land hath itsown exercises, and this may be new to the Melech Ric.? Sosaying, he took from the floor a cushion of silk and down,and placed it upright on one end. ?Can thy weapon, mybrother, sever that cushion?? he said to King Richard.?No, surely,? replied the King; ?no sword on earth, were itthe Excalibur of King Arthur, can cut that which opposes nosteady resistance to the blow.??Mark, then,? said Saladin; and tucking up the sleeve ofhis gown, showed his arm, thin indeed and spare, but whichconstant exercise had hardened into a mass consisting ofnought but bone, brawn, and sinew. He unsheathed his scimi-tar, a curved and narrow blade, which glittered not like theswords of the Franks, but was, on the contrary, of a dull bluecolour, marked with ten millions of meandering lines, whichshowed how anxiously the metal had been welded by thearmourer. Wielding this weapon, apparently so inefficientwhen compared to that of Richard, the Soldan stood restinghis weight upon his left foot, which was slightly advanced;he balanced himself a little, as if to steady his aim; then step-ping at once forward, drew the scimitar across the cushion,applying the edge so dexterously, and with so little apparenteffort, that the cushion seemed rather to fall asunder than tobe divided by violence. 308The Talisman?It is a juggler?s trick,? said De Vaux, darting forward andsnatching up the portion of the cushion which had been cutoff, as if to assure himself of the reality of the feat; ?there isgramarye in this.?The Soldan seemed to comprehend him, for he undid thesort of veil which he had hitherto morn, laid it double alongthe edge of his sabre, extended the weapon edgeways in theair, and drawing it suddenly through the veil, although ithung on the blade entirely loose, severed that also into twoparts, which floated to different sides of the tent, equallydisplaying the extreme temper and sharpness of the weapon,and the exquisite dexterity of him who used it.?Now, in good faith, my brother,? said Richard, ?thou arteven matchless at the trick of the sword, and right perilouswere it to meet thee! Still, however, I put some faith in adownright English blow, and what we cannot do by sleightwe eke out by strength. Nevertheless, in truth thou art asexpert in inflicting wounds as my sage Hakim in curing them.I trust I shall see the learned leech. I have much to thank;him for, and had brought some small present.?As he spoke, Saladin exchanged his turban for a Tartar cap.He had no sooner done so, than De Vaux opened at once hisextended mouth and his large, round eyes, and Richard gazedwith scarce less astonishment, while the Soldan spoke in agrave and altered voice: ?The sick man, saith the poet, whilehe is yet infirm, knoweth the physician by his step; but whenhe is recovered, he knoweth not even his face when he looksupon him.??A miracle!?a miracle!? exclaimed Richard.?Of Mahound?s working, doubtless,? said Thomas de Vaux.?That I should lose my learned Hakim,? said Richard,?merely by absence of his cap and robe, and that I shouldfind him again in my royal brother Saladin!??Such is oft the fashion of the world,? answered the Soldan;?the tattered robe makes not always the dervise.??And it was through thy intercession,? said Richard, ?thatyonder Knight of the Leopard was saved from death, and bythy artifice that he revisited my camp in disguise???Even so,? replied Saladin. ?I was physician enough to knowthat, unless the wounds of his bleeding honour were stanched,the days of his life must be few. His disguise was more easilypenetrated than I had expected from the success of my own.? 309Sir Walter Scott?An accident,? said King Richard (probably alluding tothe circumstance of his applying his lips to the wound of thesupposed Nubian), ?let me first know that his skin was arti-ficially discoloured; and that hint once taken, detection be-came easy, for his form and person are not to be forgotten. Iconfidently expect that he will do battle on the morrow.??He is full in preparation, and high in hope,? said theSoldan. ?I have furnished him with weapons and horse, think-ing nobly of him from what I have seen under various dis-guises.??Knows he now,? said Richard, ?to whom he lies underobligation???He doth,? replied the Saracen. ?I was obliged to confessmy person when I unfolded my purpose.??And confessed he aught to you?? said the King of En-gland.?Nothing explicit,? replied the Soldan; ?but from muchthat passed between us, I conceive his love is too highly placedto be happy in its issue.??And thou knowest that his daring and insolent passioncrossed thine own wishes?? said Richard.?I might guess so much,? said Saladin; ?but his passionhad existed ere my wishes had been formed?and, I mustnow add, is likely to survive them. I cannot, in honour, re-venge me for my disappointment on him who had no handin it. Or, if this high-born dame loved him better than my-self, who can say that she did not justice to a knight of herown religion, who is full of nobleness???Yet of too mean lineage to mix with the blood ofPlantagenet,? said Richard haughtily.?Such may be your maxims in Frangistan,? replied theSoldan. ?Our poets of the Eastern countries say that a val-iant camel-driver is worthy to kiss the lip of a fair Queen,when a cowardly prince is not worthy to salute the hem ofher garment. But with your permission, noble brother, I musttake leave of thee for the present, to receive the Duke ofAustria and yonder Nazarene knight, much less worthy ofhospitality, but who must yet be suitably entreated, not fortheir sakes, but for mine own honour?for what saith thesage Lokman? ?Say not that the food is lost unto thee whichis given to the stranger; for if his body be strengthened andfattened therewithal, not less is thine own worship and good 310The Talismanname cherished and augmented.??The Saracen Monarch departed from King Richard?s tent,and having indicated to him, rather with signs than withspeech, where the pavilion of the Queen and her attendantswas pitched, he went to receive the Marquis of Montserratand his attendants, for whom, with less goodwill, but withequal splendour, the magnificent Soldan had provided ac-commodations. The most ample refreshments, both in theOriental and after the European fashion, were spread beforethe royal and princely guests of Saladin, each in their ownseparate pavilion; and so attentive was the Soldan to the habitsand taste of his visitors, that Grecian slaves were stationed topresent them with the goblet, which is the abomination ofthe sect of Mohammed. Ere Richard had finished his meal,the ancient Omrah, who had brought the Soldan?s letter tothe Christian camp, entered with a plan of the ceremonial tobe observed on the succeeding day of combat. Richard, whoknew the taste of his old acquaintance, invited him to pledgehim in a flagon of wine of Shiraz; but Abdallah gave him tounderstand, with a rueful aspect, that self-denial in the presentcircumstances was a matter in which his life was concerned,for that Saladin, tolerant in many respects, both observedand enforced by high penalties the laws of the Prophet.?Nay, then,? said Richard, ?if he loves not wine, that light-ener of the human heart, his conversion is not to be hopedfor, and the prediction of the mad priest of Engaddi goeslike chaff down the wind.?The King then addressed himself to settle the articles ofcombat, which cost a considerable time, as it was necessaryon some points to consult with the opposite parties, as wellas with the Soldan.They were at length finally agreed upon, and adjusted by aprotocol in French and in Arabian, which was subscribed bySaladin as umpire of the field, and by Richard and Leopoldas guarantees for the two combatants. As the Omrah tookhis final leave of King Richard for the evening, De Vauxentered.?The good knight,? he said, ?who is to do battle tomorrowrequests to know whether he may not to-night pay duty tohis royal godfather!??Hast thou seen him, De Vaux?? said the King, smiling;?and didst thou know an ancient acquaintance?? 311Sir Walter Scott?By our Lady of Lanercost,? answered De Vaux, ?there areso many surprises and changes in this land that my poorbrain turns. I scarce knew Sir Kenneth of Scotland, till hisgood hound, that had been for a short while under my care,came and fawned on me; and even then I only knew the tykeby the depth of his chest, the roundness of his foot, and hismanner of baying, for the poor gazehound was painted likeany Venetian courtesan.??Thou art better skilled in brutes than men, De Vaux,?said the King.?I will not deny,? said De Vaux, ?I have found them ofttimesthe honester animals. Also, your Grace is pleased to term mesometimes a brute myself; besides that, I serve the Lion,whom all men acknowledge the king of brutes.??By Saint George, there thou brokest thy lance fairly onmy brow,? said the King. ?I have ever said thou hast a sort ofwit, De Vaux; marry, one must strike thee with a sledge-hammer ere it can be made to sparkle. But to the presentgear?is the good knight well armed and equipped???Fully, my liege, and nobly,? answered De Vaux. ?I knowthe armour well; it is that which the Venetian commissaryoffered your highness, just ere you became ill, for five hun-dred byzants.??And he hath sold it to the infidel Soldan, I warrant me,for a few ducats more, and present payment. These Vene-tians would sell the Sepulchre itself!??The armour will never be borne in a nobler cause,? saidDe Vaux.?Thanks to the nobleness of the Saracen,? said the King,?not to the avarice of the Venetians.??I would to God your Grace would be more cautious,?said the anxious De Vaux. ?Here are we deserted by all ourallies, for points of offence given to one or another; we can-not hope to prosper upon the land; and we have only toquarrel with the amphibious republic, to lose the means ofretreat by sea!??I will take care,? said Richard impatiently; ?but schoolme no more. Tell me rather, for it is of interest, hath theknight a confessor???He hath,? answered De Vaux; ?the hermit of Engaddi.who erst did him that office when preparing for death, at-tends him on the present occasion, the fame of the duel hav- 312The Talismaning brought him hither.???Tis well,? said Richard; ?and now for the knight?s request.Say to him, Richard will receive him when the discharge ofhis devoir beside the Diamond of the Desert shall have atonedfor his fault beside the Mount of Saint George; and as thoupassest through the camp, let the Queen know I will visither pavilion?and tell Blondel to meet me there.?De Vaux departed, and in about an hour afterwards, Rich-ard, wrapping his mantle around him, and taking his ghitternin his hand, walked in the direction of the Queen?s pavilion.Several Arabs passed him, but always with averted heads andlooks fixed upon the earth, though he could observe that allgazed earnestly after him when he was past. This led himjustly to conjecture that his person was known to them; butthat either the Soldan?s commands, or their own Orientalpoliteness, forbade them to seem to notice a sovereign whodesired to remain incognito.When the King reached the pavilion of his Queen he foundit guarded by those unhappy officials whom Eastern jeal-ousy places around the zenana. Blondel was walking beforethe door, and touched his rote from time to time in a man-ner which made the Africans show their ivory teeth, andbear burden with their strange gestures and shrill, unnaturalvoices.?What art thou after with this herd of black cattle, Blondel??said the King; ?wherefore goest thou not into the tent???Because my trade can neither spare the head nor the fin-gers,? said Blondel, ?and these honest blackamoors threat-ened to cut me joint from joint if I pressed forward.??Well, enter with me,? said the King, ?and I will be thysafeguard.?The blacks accordingly lowered pikes and swords to KingRichard, and bent their eyes on the ground, as if unworthyto look upon him. In the interior of the pavilion they foundThomas de Vaux in attendance on the Queen. WhileBerengaria welcomed Blondel, King Richard spoke for sometime secretly and apart with his fair kinswoman.At length, ?Are we still foes, my fair Edith?? he said, in awhisper.?No, my liege,? said Edith, in a voice just so low as not tointerrupt the music; ?none can bear enmity against KingRichard when he deigns to show himself, as he really is, gen- 313Sir Walter Scotterous and noble, as well as valiant and honourable.?So saying, she extended her hand to him. The King kissedit in token of reconciliation, and then proceeded.?You think, my sweet cousin, that my anger in this matterwas feigned; but you are deceived. The punishment I in-flicted upon this knight was just; for he had betrayed?nomatter for how tempting a bribe, fair cousin?the trust com-mitted to him. But I rejoice, perchance as much as you, thatto-morrow gives him a chance to win the field, and throwback the stain which for a time clung to him upon the actualthief and traitor. No!?future times may blame Richard forimpetuous folly, but they shall say that in rendering judg-ment he was just when he should and merciful when hecould.??Laud not thyself, cousin King,? said Edith. ?They maycall thy justice cruelty, thy mercy caprice.??And do not thou pride thyself,? said the King, ?as if thyknight, who hath not yet buckled on his armour, wereunbelting it in triumph?Conrade of Montserrat is held agood lance. What if the Scot should lose the day???It is impossible!? said Edith firmly. ?My own eyes sawyonder Conrade tremble and change colour like a base thief;he is guilty, and the trial by combat is an appeal to the justiceof God. I myself, in such a cause, would encounter him with-out fear.??By the mass, I think thou wouldst, wench,? said the King,?and beat him to boot, for there never breathed a truerPlantagenet than thou.? He paused, and added in a very serious tone, ?See thatthou continue to remember what is due to thy birth.??What means that advice, so seriously given at this mo-ment?? said Edith. ?Am I of such light nature as to forget myname?my condition???I will speak plainly, Edith,? answered the King, ?and as toa friend. What will this knight be to you, should he come offvictor from yonder lists???To me?? said Edith, blushing deep with shame and dis-pleasure. ?What can he be to me more than an honouredknight, worthy of such grace as Queen Berengaria mightconfer on him, had he selected her for his lady, instead of amore unworthy choice? The meanest knight may devote him-self to the service of an empress, but the glory of his choice,? 314The Talismanshe said proudly, ?must be his reward.??Yet he hath served and suffered much for you,? said theKing.?I have paid his services with honour and applause, andhis sufferings with tears,? answered Edith. ?Had he desiredother reward, he would have done wisely to have bestowedhis affections within his own degree.??You would not, then, wear the bloody night-gear for hissake?? said King Richard.?No more,? answered Edith, ?than I would have requiredhim to expose his life by an action in which there was moremadness than honour.??Maidens talk ever thus,? said the King; ?but when thefavoured lover presses his suit, she says, with a sigh, her starshad decreed otherwise.??Your Grace has now, for the second time, threatened mewith the influence of my horoscope,? Edith replied, withdignity. ?Trust me, my liege, whatever be the power of thestars, your poor kinswoman will never wed either infidel orobscure adventurer, Permit me that I listen to the music ofBlondel, for the tone of your royal admonitions is scarce sograteful to the ear.?The conclusion of the evening offered nothing worthy ofnotice. 315Sir Walter ScottCHAPTER XXVIII.Heard ye the din of battle bray,Lance to lance, and horse to horse?Gray.IT HAD BEEN AGREED, on account of the heat of the climate,that the judicial combat which was the cause of the presentassemblage of various nations at the Diamond of the Desertshould take place at one hour after sunrise. The wide lists,which had been constructed under the inspection of theKnight of the Leopard, enclosed a space of hard sand, whichwas one hundred and twenty yards long by forty in width.They extended in length from north to south, so as to giveboth parties the equal advantage of the rising sun. Saladin?sroyal seat was erected on the western side of the enclosure,just in the centre, where the combatants were expected tomeet in mid encounter. Opposed to this was a gallery withclosed casements, so contrived that the ladies, for whose ac-commodation it was erected, might see the fight withoutbeing themselves exposed to view. At either extremity of thelists was a barrier, which could be opened or shut at pleasure.Thrones had been also erected, but the Archduke, perceivingthat his was lower than King Richard?s, refused to occupy it;and Coeur de Lion, who would have submitted to much ereany formality should have interfered with the combat, readilyagreed that the sponsors, as they were called, should remainon horseback during the fight. At one extremity of the listswere placed the followers of Richard, and opposed to themwere those who accompanied the defender Conrade. Aroundthe throne destined for the Soldan were ranged his splendidGeorgian Guards, and the rest of the enclosure was occupiedby Christian and Mohammedan spectators.Long before daybreak the lists were surrounded by even alarger number of Saracens than Richard had seen on the pre-ceding evening. When the first ray of the sun?s glorious orbarose above the desert, the sonorous call, ?To prayer?toprayer!? was poured forth by the Soldan himself, and an-swered by others, whose rank and zeal entitled them to act asmuezzins. It was a striking spectacle to see them all sink toearth, for the purpose of repeating their devotions, with their 316The Talismanfaces turned to Mecca. But when they arose from the ground,the sun?s rays, now strengthening fast, seemed to confirmthe Lord of Gilsland?s conjecture of the night before. Theywere flashed back from many a spearhead, for the pointlesslances of the preceding day were certainly no longer such.De Vaux pointed it out to his master, who answered withimpatience that he had perfect confidence in the good faithof the Soldan; but if De Vaux was afraid of his bulky body,he might retire.Soon after this the noise of timbrels was heard, at the soundof which the whole Saracen cavaliers threw themselves fromtheir horses, and prostrated themselves, as if for a secondmorning prayer. This was to give an opportunity to theQueen, with Edith and her attendants, to pass from the pa-vilion to the gallery intended for them. Fifty guards ofSaladin?s seraglio escorted them with naked sabres, whoseorders were to cut to pieces whomsoever, were he prince orpeasant, should venture to gaze on the ladies as they passed,or even presume to raise his head until the cessation of themusic should make all men aware that they were lodged intheir gallery, not to be gazed on by the curious eye.This superstitious observance of Oriental reverence to thefair sex called forth from Queen Berengaria some criticismsvery unfavourable to Saladin and his country. But their den,as the royal fair called it, being securely closed and guardedby their sable attendants, she was under the necessity of con-tenting herself with seeing, and laying aside for the presentthe still more exquisite pleasure of being seen.Meantime the sponsors of both champions went, as wastheir duty, to see that they were duly armed and prepared forcombat. The Archduke of Austria was in no hurry to per-form this part of the ceremony, having had rather an unusu-ally severe debauch upon wine of Shiraz the precedingevening. But the Grand Master of the Temple, more deeplyconcerned in the event of the combat, was early before thetent of Conrade of Montserrat. To his great surprise, the at-tendants refused him admittance.?Do you not know me, ye knaves?? said the Grand Master,in great anger.?We do, most valiant and reverend,? answered Conrade?ssquire; ?but even you may not at present enter?the Mar-quis is about to confess himself.? 317Sir Walter Scott?Confess himself!? exclaimed the Templar, in a tone wherealarm mingled with surprise and scorn??and to whom, Ipray thee???My master bid me be secret,? said the squire; on whichthe Grand Master pushed past him, and entered the tentalmost by force.The Marquis of Montserrat was kneeling at the feet of thehermit of Engaddi, and in the act of beginning his confes-sion.?What means this, Marquis?? said the Grand Master; ?up,for shame?or, if you must needs confess, am not I here???I have confessed to you too often already,? repliedConrade, with a pale cheek and a faltering voice. ?For God?ssake, Grand Master, begone, and let me unfold my conscienceto this holy man.??In what is he holier than I am?? said the Grand Master.??Hermit, prophet, madman?say, if thou darest, in whatthou excellest me???Bold and bad man,? replied the hermit, ?know that I amlike the latticed window, and the divine light passes throughto avail others, though, alas! it helpeth not me. Thou art likethe iron stanchions, which neither receive light themselves,nor communicate it to any one.??Prate not to me, but depart from this tent,? said the GrandMaster; ?the Marquis shall not confess this morning, unlessit be to me, for I part not from his side.??Is this your pleasure?? said the hermit to Conrade; ?forthink not I will obey that proud man, if you continue todesire my assistance.??Alas,? said Conrade irresolutely, ?what would you haveme say? Farewell for a while?we will speak anon.??O procrastination!? exclaimed the hermit, ?thou art a soul-murderer!?Unhappy man, farewell?not for a while, butuntil we shall both meet no matter where. And for thee,? headded, turning to the Grand Master, ?Tremble!??Tremble!? replied the Templar contemptuously, ?I can-not if I would.?The hermit heard not his answer, having left the tent.?Come! to this gear hastily,? said the Grand Master, ?sincethou wilt needs go through the foolery. Hark thee?I thinkI know most of thy frailties by heart, so we may omit thedetail, which may be somewhat a long one, and begin with 318The Talismanthe absolution. What signifies counting the spots of dirt thatwe are about to wash from our hands???Knowing what thou art thyself,? said Conrade, ?it is blas-phemous to speak of pardoning another.??That is not according to the canon, Lord Marquis,? saidthe Templar; ?thou art more scrupulous than orthodox. Theabsolution of the wicked priest is as effectual as if he werehimself a saint?otherwise, God help the poor penitent! Whatwounded man inquires whether the surgeon that tends hisgashes has clean hands or no? Come, shall we to this toy???No,? said Conrade, ?I will rather die unconfessed thanmock the sacrament.??Come, noble Marquis,? said the Templar, ?rouse up yourcourage, and speak not thus. In an hour?s time thou shaltstand victorious in the lists, or confess thee in thy helmet,like a valiant knight.??Alas, Grand Master,? answered Conrade, ?all augurs illfor this affair, The strange discovery by the instinct of a dog?the revival of this Scottish knight, who comes into the listslike a spectre?all betokens evil.??Pshaw,? said the Templar, ?I have seen thee bend thy lanceboldly against him in sport, and with equal chance of suc-cess. Think thou art but in a tournament, and who bearshim better in the tilt-yard than thou??Come, squires andarmourers, your master must be accoutred for the field.?The attendants entered accordingly, and began to arm theMarquis.?What morning is without?? said Conrade.?The sun rises dimly,? answered a squire.?Thou seest, Grand Master,? said Conrade, ?nought smileson us.??Thou wilt fight the more coolly, my son,? answered theTemplar; ?thank Heaven, that hath tempered the sun of Pal-estine to suit thine occasion.?Thus jested the Grand Master. But his jests had lost theirinfluence on the harassed mind of the Marquis, and not-withstanding his attempts to seem gay, his gloom communi-cated itself to the Templar.?This craven,? he thought, ?will lose the day in pure faint-ness and cowardice of heart, which he calls tender conscience.I, whom visions and auguries shake not?who am firm inmy purpose as the living rock?I should have fought the 319Sir Walter Scottcombat myself. Would to God the Scot may strike him deadon the spot; it were next best to his winning the victory. Butcome what will, he must have no other confessor than my-self?our sins are too much in common, and he might con-fess my share with his own.?While these thoughts passed through his mind, he contin-ued to assist the Marquis in arming, but it was in silence.The hour at length arrived; the trumpets sounded; theknights rode into the lists armed at all points, and mountedlike men who were to do battle for a kingdom?s honour. Theywore their visors up, and riding around the lists three times,showed themselves to the spectators. Both were goodly per-sons, and both had noble countenances. But there was an airof manly confidence on the brow of the Scot?a radiancy ofhope, which amounted even to cheerfulness; while, althoughpride and effort had recalled much of Conrade?s natural cour-age, there lowered still on his brow a cloud of ominous de-spondence. Even his steed seemed to tread less lightly andblithely to the trumpet-sound than the noble Arab which wasbestrode by Sir Kenneth; and the Spruch-Sprecher shook hishead while he observed that, while the challenger rode aroundthe lists in the course of the sun?that is, from right to left?the defender made the same circuit widdersins?that is, fromleft to right?which is in most countries held ominous.A temporary altar was erected just beneath the gallery oc-cupied by the Queen, and beside it stood the hermit in thedress of his order as a Carmelite friar. Other churchmen werealso present. To this altar the challenger and defender weresuccessively brought forward, conducted by their respectivesponsors. Dismounting before it, each knight avouched thejustice of his cause by a solemn oath on the Evangelists, andprayed that his success might be according to the truth orfalsehood of what he then swore. They also made oath thatthey came to do battle in knightly guise, and with the usualweapons, disclaiming the use of spells, charms, or magicaldevices to incline victory to their side. The challenger pro-nounced his vow with a firm and manly voice, and a boldand cheerful countenance. When the ceremony was finished,the Scottish Knight looked at the gallery, and bent his headto the earth, as if in honour of those invisible beauties whichwere enclosed within; then, loaded with armour as he was,sprung to the saddle without the use of the stirrup, and made 320The Talismanhis courser carry him in a succession of caracoles to his stationat the eastern extremity of the lists. Conrade also presentedhimself before the altar with boldness enough; but his voice ashe took the oath sounded hollow, as if drowned in his helmet.The lips with which he appealed to Heaven to adjudge victoryto the just quarrel grew white as they uttered the impiousmockery. As he turned to remount his horse, the Grand Mas-ter approached him closer, as if to rectify something about thesitting of his gorget, and whispered, ?Coward and fool! recallthy senses, and do me this battle bravely, else, by Heaven,shouldst thou escape him, thou escapest not me!?The savage tone in which this was whispered perhaps com-pleted the confusion of the Marquis?s nerves, for hestumbled as he made to horse; and though he recovered hisfeet, sprung to the saddle with his usual agility, and dis-played his address in horsemanship as he assumed his posi-tion opposite to the challenger?s, yet the accident did notescape those who were on the watch for omens which mightpredict the fate of the day.The priests, after a solemn prayer that God would showthe rightful quarrel, departed from the lists. The trumpets ofthe challenger then rung a flourish, and a herald-at-armsproclaimed at the eastern end of the lists??Here stands agood knight, Sir Kenneth of Scotland, champion for the royalKing Richard of England, who accuseth Conrade, Marquisof Montserrat, of foul treason and dishonour done to thesaid King.?When the words Kenneth of Scotland announced the nameand character of the champion, hitherto scarce generallyknown, a loud and cheerful acclaim burst from the followersof King Richard, and hardly, notwithstanding repeated com-mands of silence, suffered the reply of the defendant to heheard. He, of course, avouched his innocence, and offeredhis body for battle. The esquires of the combatants now ap-proached, and delivered to each his shield and lance, assist-ing to hang the former around his neck, that his two handsmight remain free, one for the management of the bridle,the other to direct the lance.The shield of the Scot displayed his old bearing, the leop-ard, but with the addition of a collar and broken chain, inallusion to his late captivity. The shield of the Marquis bore,in reference to his title, a serrated and rocky mountain. Each 321Sir Walter Scottshook his lance aloft, as if to ascertain the weight and tough-ness of the unwieldy weapon, and then laid it in the rest.The sponsors, heralds, and squires now retired to the barri-ers, and the combatants sat opposite to each other, face toface, with couched lance and closed visor, the human formso completely enclosed, that they looked more like statues ofmolten iron than beings of flesh and blood. The silence ofsuspense was now general. Men breathed thicker, and theirvery souls seemed seated in their eyes; while not a sound wasto be heard save the snorting and pawing of the good steeds,who, sensible of what was about to happen, were impatientto dash into career. They stood thus for perhaps three min-utes, when, at a signal given by the Soldan, a hundred in-struments rent the air with their brazen clamours, and eachchampion striking his horse with the spurs, and slacking therein, the horses started into full gallop, and the knights metin mid space with a shock like a thunderbolt. The victorywas not in doubt?no, not one moment. Conrade, indeed,showed himself a practised warrior; for he struck his antago-nist knightly in the midst of his shield, bearing his lance sostraight and true that it shivered into splinters from the steelspear-head up to the very gauntlet. The horse of Sir Kennethrecoiled two or three yards and fell on his haunches; but therider easily raised him with hand and rein. But for Conradethere was no recovery. Sir Kenneth?s lance had pierced throughthe shield, through a plated corselet of Milan steel, througha secret, or coat of linked mail, worn beneath the corselet,had wounded him deep in the bosom, and borne him fromhis saddle, leaving the truncheon of the lance fixed in hiswound. The sponsors, heralds, and Saladin himself, descend-ing from his throne, crowded around the wounded man;while Sir Kenneth, who had drawn his sword ere yet he dis-covered his antagonist was totally helpless, now commandedhim to avow his guilt. The helmet was hastily unclosed, andthe wounded man, gazing wildly on the skies, replied, ?Whatwould you more? God hath decided justly?I am guilty; butthere are worse traitors in the camp than I. In pity to mysoul, let me have a confessor!?He revived as he uttered these words.?The talisman?the powerful remedy, royal brother!? saidKing Richard to Saladin.?The traitor,? answered the Soldan, ?is more fit to be 322The Talismandragged from the lists to the gallows by the heels, than toprofit by its virtues. And some such fate is in his look,? headded, after gazing fixedly upon the wounded man; ?forthough his wound may be cured, yet Azrael?s seal is on thewretch?s brow.??Nevertheless,? said Richard, ?I pray you do for him whatyou may, that he may at least have time for confession. Slaynot soul and body! To him one half hour of time may beworth more, by ten thousandfold, than the life of the oldestpatriarch.??My royal brother?s wish shall be obeyed,? said Saladin.??Slaves, bear this wounded man to our tent.??Do not so,? said the Templar, who had hitherto stoodgloomily looking on in silence. ?The royal Duke of Austriaand myself will not permit this unhappy Christian prince tobe delivered over to the Saracens, that they may try theirspells upon him. We are his sponsors, and demand that hebe assigned to our care.??That is, you refuse the certain means offered to recoverhim?? said Richard.?Not so,? said the Grand Master, recollecting himself. ?Ifthe Soldan useth lawful medicines, he may attend the pa-tient in my tent.??Do so, I pray thee, good brother,? said Richard to Saladin,?though the permission be ungraciously yielded.?But nowto a more glorious work. Sound, trumpets?shout, En-gland?in honour of England?s champion!?Drum, clarion, trumpet, and cymbal rung forth at once,and the deep and regular shout, which for ages has been theEnglish acclamation, sounded amidst the shrill and irregularyells of the Arabs, like the diapason of the organ amid thehowling of a storm. There was silence at length.?Brave Knight of the Leopard,? resumed Coeur de Lion,?thou hast shown that the Ethiopian may change his skin,and the leopard his spots, though clerks quote Scripture forthe impossibility. Yet I have more to say to you when I haveconducted you to the presence of the ladies, the best judgesand best rewarders of deeds of chivalry.?The Knight of the Leopard bowed assent.?And thou, princely Saladin, wilt also attend them. I prom-ise thee our Queen will not think herself welcome, if shelacks the opportunity to thank her royal host for her most 323Sir Walter Scottprincely reception.?Saladin bent his head gracefully, but declined the invita-tion.?I must attend the wounded man,? he said. ?The leechleaves not his patient more than the champion the lists, evenif he be summoned to a bower like those of Paradise. Andfurther, royal Richard, know that the blood of the East flowsnot so temperately in the presence of beauty as that of yourland. What saith the Book itself??Her eye is as the edge ofthe sword of the Prophet, who shall look upon it? He thatwould not be burnt avoideth to tread on hot embers?wisemen spread not the flax before a bickering torch. He, saiththe sage, who hath forfeited a treasure, doth not wisely toturn back his head to gaze at it.?Richard, it may be believed, respected the motives of deli-cacy which flowed from manners so different from his own,and urged his request no further.?At noon,? said the Soldan, as he departed, ?I trust ye willall accept a collation under the black camel-skin tent of achief of Kurdistan.?The same invitation was circulated among the Christians,comprehending all those of sufficient importance to be ad-mitted to sit at a feast made for princes.?Hark!? said Richard, ?the timbrels announce that ourQueen and her attendants are leaving their gallery?and see,the turbans sink on the ground, as if struck down by a de-stroying angel. All lie prostrate, as if the glance of an Arab?seye could sully the lustre of a lady?s cheek! Come, we will tothe pavilion, and lead our conqueror thither in triumph. HowI pity that noble Soldan, who knows but of love as it is knownto those of inferior nature!?Blondel tuned his harp to his boldest measure, to welcomethe introduction of the victor into the pavilion of QueenBerengaria. He entered, supported on either side by his spon-sors, Richard and Thomas Longsword, and knelt gracefullydown before the Queen, though more than half the homagewas silently rendered to Edith, who sat on her right hand.?Unarm him, my mistresses,? said the King, whose delightwas in the execution of such chivalrous usages; ?let Beautyhonour Chivalry! Undo his spurs, Berengaria; Queen thoughthou be, thou owest him what marks of favour thou canstgive.?Unlace his helmet, Edith;?by this hand thou shalt, 324The Talismanwert thou the proudest Plantagenet of the line, and he thepoorest knight on earth!?Both ladies obeyed the royal commands?Berengaria withbustling assiduity, as anxious to gratify her husband?s humour,and Edith blushing and growing pale alternately, as, slowlyand awkwardly, she undid, with Longsword?s assistance, thefastenings which secured the helmet to the gorget.?And what expect you from beneath this iron shell?? saidRichard, as the removal of the casque gave to view the noblecountenance of Sir Kenneth, his face glowing with recentexertion, and not less so with present emotion. ?What thinkye of him, gallants and beauties?? said Richard. ?Doth heresemble an Ethiopian slave, or doth he present the face ofan obscure and nameless adventurer? No, by my good sword!Here terminate his various disguises. He hath knelt downbefore you unknown, save by his worth; he arises equallydistinguished by birth and by fortune. The adventurousknight, Kenneth, arises David, Earl of Huntingdon, PrinceRoyal of Scotland!?There was a general exclamation of surprise, and Edith droppedfrom her hand the helmet which she had just received.?Yes, my masters,? said the King, ?it is even so. Ye knowhow Scotland deceived us when she proposed to send thisvaliant Earl, with a bold company of her best and noblest, toaid our arms in this conquest of Palestine, but failed to com-ply with her engagements. This noble youth, under whomthe Scottish Crusaders were to have been arrayed, thoughtfoul scorn that his arm should he withheld from the holy war-fare, and joined us at Sicily with a small train of devoted andfaithful attendants, which was augmented by many of his coun-trymen to whom the rank of their leader was unknown. Theconfidants of the Royal Prince had all, save one old follower,fallen by death, when his secret, but too well kept, had nearlyoccasioned my cutting off, in a Scottish adventurer, one of thenoblest hopes of Europe.?Why did you not mention yourrank, noble Huntingdon, when endangered by my hasty andpassionate sentence? Was it that you thought Richard capableof abusing the advantage I possessed over the heir of a Kingwhom I have so often found hostile???I did you not that injustice, royal Richard,? answered theEarl of Huntingdon; ?but my pride brooked not that I shouldavow myself Prince of Scotland in order to save my life, en- 325Sir Walter Scottdangered for default of loyalty. And, moreover, I had mademy vow to preserve my rank unknown till the Crusade shouldbe accomplished; nor did I mention it save in articulo mortis,and under the seal of confession, to yonder reverend hermit.??It was the knowledge of that secret, then, which made thegood man so urgent with me to recall my severe sentence??said Richard. ?Well did he say that, had this good knightfallen by my mandate, I should have wished the deed un-done though it had cost me a limb. A limb! I should havewished it undone had it cost me my life?since the worldwould have said that Richard had abused the condition inwhich the heir of Scotland had placed himself by his confi-dence in his generosity.??Yet, may we know of your Grace by what strange andhappy chance this riddle was at length read?? said the QueenBerengaria.?Letters were brought to us from England,? said the King,?in which we learned, among other unpleasant news, thatthe King of Scotland had seized upon three of our nobles,when on a pilgrimage to Saint Ninian, and alleged, as a cause,that his heir, being supposed to be fighting in the ranks ofthe Teutonic Knights against the heathen of Borussia, was,in fact, in our camp, and in our power; and, therefore, Wil-liam proposed to hold these nobles as hostages for his safety.This gave me the first light on the real rank of the Knight ofthe Leopard; and my suspicions were confirmed by De Vaux,who, on his return from Ascalon, brought back with himthe Earl of Huntingdon?s sole attendant, a thick-skulled slave,who had gone thirty miles to unfold to De Vaux a secret heshould have told to me.??Old Strauchan must be excused,? said the Lord ofGilsland. ?He knew from experience that my heart is some-what softer than if I wrote myself Plantagenet.??Thy heart soft? thou commodity of old iron andCumberland flint, that thou art!? exclaimed the King.??Itis we Plantagenets who boast soft and feeling hearts, Edith,?turning to his cousin with an expression which called theblood into her cheek, ?give me thy hand, my fair cousin,and, Prince of Scotland, thine.??Forbear, my lord,? said Edith, hanging back, and endeav-ouring to hide her confusion under an attempt to rally herroyal kinsman?s credulity. ?Remember you not that my hand 326The Talismanwas to be the signal of converting to the Christian faith theSaracen and Arab, Saladin and all his turbaned host???Ay, but the wind of prophecy hath chopped about, andsits now in another corner,? replied Richard.?Mock not, lest your bonds be made strong,? said the her-mit stepping forward. ?The heavenly host write nothing buttruth in their brilliant records it is man?s eyes which are tooweak to read their characters aright. Know, that when Saladinand Kenneth of Scotland slept in my grotto, I read in thestars that there rested under my roof a prince, the natural foeof Richard, with whom the fate of Edith Plantagenet was tobe united. Could I doubt that this must be the Soldan, whoserank was well known to me, as he often visited my cell toconverse on the revolutions of the heavenly bodies? Again,the lights of the firmament proclaimed that this prince, thehusband of Edith Plantagenet, should be a Christian; andI?weak and wild interpreter!?argued thence the conver-sion of the noble Saladin, whose good qualities seemed of-ten to incline him towards the better faith. The sense of myweakness hath humbled me to the dust; but in the dust Ihave found comfort! I have not read aright the fate of oth-ers?who can assure me but that I may have miscalculatedmine own? God will not have us break into His council-house, or spy out His hidden mysteries. We must wait Histime with watching and prayer?with fear and with hope. Icame hither the stern seer ?the proud prophet?skilled, asI thought, to instruct princes, and gifted even with super-natural powers, but burdened with a weight which I deemedno shoulders but mine could have borne. But my bands havebeen broken! I go hence humble in mine ignorance, peni-tent?and not hopeless.?With these words he withdrew from the assembly; and it isrecorded that from that period his frenzy fits seldom occurred,and his penances were of a milder character, and accompaniedwith better hopes of the future. So much is there of self-opin-ion, even in insanity, that the conviction of his having enter-tained and expressed an unfounded prediction with so muchvehemence seemed to operate like loss of blood on the humanframe, to modify and lower the fever of the brain.It is needless to follow into further particulars the confer-ences at the royal tent, or to inquire whether David, Earl ofHuntingdon, was as mute in the presence of Edith 327Sir Walter ScottPlantagenet as when he was bound to act under the charac-ter of an obscure and nameless adventurer. It may be wellbelieved that he there expressed with suitable earnestness thepassion to which he had so often before found it difficult togive words.The hour of noon now approached, and Saladin waited toreceive the Princes of Christendom in a tent, which, but forits large size, differed little from that of the ordinary shelterof the common Kurdman, or Arab; yet beneath its ampleand sable covering was prepared a banquet after the mostgorgeous fashion of the East, extended upon carpets of therichest stuffs, with cushions laid for the guests. But we can-not stop to describe the cloth of gold and silver?the superbembroidery in arabesque?the shawls of Kashmere and themuslins of India, which were here unfolded in all theirsplendour; far less to tell the different sweetmeats, ragoutsedged with rice coloured in various manners, with all theother niceties of Eastern cookery, Lambs roasted whole, andgame and poultry dressed in pilaus, were piled in vessels ofgold, and silver, and porcelain, and intermixed with largemazers of sherbet, cooled in snow and ice from the cavernsof Mount Lebanon. A magnificent pile of cushions at thehead of the banquet seemed prepared for the master of thefeast, and such dignitaries as he might call to share that placeof distinction; while from the roof of the tent in all quarters,but over this seat of eminence in particular, waved many abanner and pennon, the trophies of battles won and king-doms overthrown. But amongst and above them all, a longlance displayed a shroud, the banner of Death, with thisimpressive inscription? ?Saladin, King of Kings?Saladin,Victor of Victors?Saladin must die.? Amid these preparations,the slaves who had arranged the refreshments stood withdrooped heads and folded arms, mute and motionless asmonumental statuary, or as automata, which waited the touchof the artist to put them in motion.Expecting the approach of his princely guests, the Soldan,imbued, as most were, with the superstitions of his time,paused over a horoscope and corresponding scroll, whichhad been sent to him by the hermit of Engaddi when hedeparted from the camp.?Strange and mysterious science,? he muttered to himself,which, pretending to draw the curtain of futurity, misleads 328The Talismanthose whom it seems to guide, and darkens the scene whichit pretends to illuminate! who would not have said that I wasthat enemy most dangerous to Richard, whose enmity wasto be ended by marriage with his kinswoman? Yet it nowappears that a union betwixt this gallant Earl and the ladywill bring about friendship betwixt Richard and Scotland,an enemy more dangerous than I, as a wild-cat in a chamberis more to be dreaded than a lion in a distant desert. Butthen? he continued to mutter to himself, ?the combinationintimates that this husband was to be Christian. ?Chris-tian!? he repeated, after a pause. ?That gave the insane fa-natic star-gazer hopes that I might renounce my faith! Butme, the faithful follower of our Prophet?me it should haveundeceived. Lie there, mysterious scroll,? he added, thrust-ing it under the pile of cushions; ?strange are thy bodementsand fatal, since, even when true in themselves, they workupon those who attempt to decipher their meaning all theeffects of falsehood.?How now! what means this intrusion??He spoke to the dwarf Nectabanus, who rushed into thetent fearfully agitated, with each strange and disproportionedfeature wrenched by horror into still more extravagant ugli-ness?his mouth open, his eyes staring, his hands, with theirshrivelled and deformed fingers, wildly expanded.?What now?? said the Soldan sternly.?Accipe Hoc!? groaned out the dwarf.?Ha! sayest thou?? answered Saladin.?Accipe Hoc!? replied the panicstruck creature, unconscious,perhaps,that he repeated the same words as before.?Hence, I am in no vein for foolery,? said the Emperor.?Nor am I further fool,? said the dwarf, ?than to make myfolly help out my wits to earn my bread, poor, helpless wretch!Hear, hear me, great Soldan!??Nay, if thou hast actual wrong to complain of,? saidSaladin, ?fool or wise, thou art entitled to the ear of a King.Retire hither with me;? and he led him into the inner tent.Whatever their conference related to, it was soon brokenoff by the fanfare of the trumpets announcing the arrival ofthe various Christian princes, whom Saladin welcomed tohis tent with a royal courtesy well becoming their rank andhis own; but chiefly he saluted the young Earl of Huntingdon,and generously congratulated him upon prospects whichseemed to have interfered with and overclouded those which 329Sir Walter Scotthe had himself entertained.?But think not,? said the Soldan, ?thou noble youth, thatthe Prince of Scotland is more welcome to Saladin than wasKenneth to the solitary Ilderim when they met in the desert,or the distressed Ethiop to the Hakim Adonbec. A brave andgenerous disposition like thine hath a value independent ofcondition and birth, as the cool draught, which I here prof-fer thee, is as delicious from an earthen vessel as from a gob-let of gold.?The Earl of Huntingdon made a suitable reply, gratefullyacknowledging the various important services he had receivedfrom the generous Soldan; but when he had pledged Saladinin the bowl of sherbet which the Soldan had proffered tohim, he could not help remarking with a smile, ?The bravecavalier Ilderim knew not of the formation of ice, but themunificent Soldan cools his sherbet with snow.??Wouldst thou have an Arab or a Kurdman as wise as aHakim?? said the Soldan. ?He who does on a disguise mustmake the sentiments of his heart and the learning of his headaccord with the dress which he assumes. I desired to see howa brave and single-hearted cavalier of Frangistan would con-duct himself in debate with such a chief as I then seemed;and I questioned the truth of a well-known fact, to know bywhat arguments thou wouldst support thy assertion.?While they were speaking, the Archduke of Austria, whostood a little apart, was struck with the mention of iced sher-bet, and took with pleasure and some bluntness the deepgoblet, as the Earl of Huntingdon was about to replace it.?Most delicious!? he exclaimed, after a deep draught, whichthe heat of the weather, and the feverishness following thedebauch of the preceding day, had rendered doubly accept-able. He sighed as he handed the cup to the Grand Master ofthe Templars. Saladin made a sign to the dwarf, who ad-vanced and pronounced, with a harsh voice, the words, accipehoc! The Templar started, like a steed who sees a lion under abush beside the pathway; yet instantly recovered, and to hide,perhaps, his confusion, raised the goblet to his lips. But thoselips never touched that goblet?s rim. The sabre of Saladin leftits sheath as lightning leaves the cloud. It was waved in theair, and the head of the Grand Master rolled to the extremityof the tent, while the trunk remained for a second standing,with the goblet still clenched in its grasp, then fell, the li- 330The Talismanquor mingling with the blood that spurted from the veins.?There was a general exclamation of treason, and Austria,nearest to whom Saladin stood with the bloody sabre in hishand, started back as if apprehensive that his turn was tocome next. Richard and others laid hand on their swords.?Fear nothing, noble Austria,? said Saladin, as compos-edly as if nothing had happened,??nor you, royal England,be wroth at what you have seen. Not for his manifold trea-sons?not for the attempt which, as may be vouched by hisown squire, he instigated against King Richard?s life?notthat he pursued the Prince of Scotland and myself in thedesert, reducing us to save our lives by the speed of ourhorses?not that he had stirred up the Maronites to attackus upon this very occasion, had I not brought up unexpect-edly so many Arabs as rendered the scheme abortive?notfor any or all of these crimes does he now lie there, althougheach were deserving such a doom?but because, scarce halfan hour ere he polluted our presence, as the simoomempoisons the atmosphere, he poniarded his comrade andaccomplice, Conrade of Montserrat, lest he should confessthe infamous plots in which they had both been engaged.??How! Conrade murdered??And by the Grand Master,his sponsor and most intimate friend!? exclaimed Richard.?Noble Soldan, I would not doubt thee; yet this must beproved, otherwise???There stands the evidence,? said Saladin, pointing to theterrified dwarf. ?Allah, who sends the fire-fly to illuminatethe night season, can discover secret crimes by the most con-temptible means.?The Soldan proceeded to tell the dwarf?s story, whichamounted to this. In his foolish curiosity, or, as he partlyconfessed, with some thoughts of pilfering, Nectabanus hadstrayed into the tent of Conrade, which had been desertedby his attendants, some of whom had left the encampmentto carry the news of his defeat to his brother, and others wereavailing themselves of the means which Saladin had sup-plied for revelling. The wounded man slept under the influ-ence of Saladin?s wonderful talisman, so that the dwarf hadopportunity to pry about at pleasure until he was frightenedinto concealment by the sound of a heavy step. He skulkedbehind a curtain, yet could see the motions, and hear thewords, of the Grand Master, who entered, and carefully se- 331Sir Walter Scottcured the covering of the pavilion behind him. His victimstarted from sleep, and it would appear that he instantly sus-pected the purpose of his old associate, for it was in a tone ofalarm that he demanded wherefore he disturbed him.?I come to confess and to absolve thee,? answered the GrandMaster.Of their further speech the terrified dwarf rememberedlittle, save that Conrade implored the Grand Master not tobreak a wounded reed, and that the Templar struck him tothe heart with a Turkish dagger, with the words accipe hoc!?words which long afterwards haunted the terrified imagina-tion of the concealed witness.?I verified the tale,? said Saladin, ?by causing the body to beexamined; and I made this unhappy being, whom Allah hathmade the discoverer of the crime, repeat in your own presencethe words which the murderer spoke; and you yourselves sawthe effect which they produced upon his conscience!?The Soldan paused, and the King of England broke si-lence.?If this be true, as I doubt not, we have witnessed a greatact of justice, though it bore a different aspect. But where-fore in this presence? wherefore with thine own hand???I had designed otherwise,? said Saladin. ?But had I nothastened his doom, it had been altogether averted, since, if Ihad permitted him to taste of my cup, as he was about to do,how could I, without incurring the brand of inhospitality,have done him to death as he deserved? Had he murderedmy father, and afterwards partaken of my food and my bowl,not a hair of his head could have been injured by me. Butenough of him?let his carcass and his memory be removedfrom amongst us.?The body was carried away, and the marks of the slaughterobliterated or concealed with such ready dexterity, as showedthat the case was not altogether so uncommon as to paralyzethe assistants and officers of Saladin?s household.But the Christian princes felt that the scene which theyhad beheld weighed heavily on their spirits, and although, atthe courteous invitation of the Soldan, they assumed theirseats at the banquet, yet it was with the silence of doubt andamazement. The spirits of Richard alone surmounted all causefor suspicion or embarrassment. Yet he too seemed to rumi-nate on some proposition, as if he were desirous of making it 332The Talismanin the most insinuating and acceptable manner which waspossible. At length he drank off a large bowl of wine, andaddressing the Soldan, desired to know whether it was nottrue that he had honoured the Earl of Huntingdon with apersonal encounter.Saladin answered with a smile that he had proved his horseand his weapons with the heir of Scotland, as cavaliers arewont to do with each other when they meet in the desert; andmodestly added that, though the combat was not entirely de-cisive, he had not on his part much reason to pride himself onthe event. The Scot, on the other hand, disclaimed the attrib-uted superiority, and wished to assign it to the Soldan.?Enough of honour thou hast had in the encounter,? saidRichard, ?and I envy thee more for that than for the smilesof Edith Plantagenet, though one of them might reward abloody day?s work.?But what say you, noble princes? Is itfitting that such a royal ring of chivalry should break upwithout something being done for future times to speak of?What is the overthrow and death of a traitor to such a fairgarland of honour as is here assembled, and which oughtnot to part without witnessing something more worthy oftheir regard??How say you, princely Soldan? What if wetwo should now, and before this fair company, decide thelong-contended question for this land of Palestine, and endat once these tedious wars? Yonder are the lists ready, nor canPaynimrie ever hope a better champion than thou. I, unlessworthier offers, will lay down my gauntlet in behalf ofChristendom, and in all love and honour we will do mortalbattle for the possession of Jerusalem.?There was a deep pause for the Soldan?s answer. His cheekand brow coloured highly, and it was the opinion of manypresent that he hesitated whether he should accept the chal-lenge. At length he said, ?Fighting for the Holy City againstthose whom we regard as idolaters and worshippers of stocksand stones and graven images, I might confide that Allahwould strengthen my arm; or if I fell beneath the sword ofthe Melech Ric, I could not pass to Paradise by a more glori-ous death. But Allah has already given Jerusalem to the truebelievers, and it were a tempting the God of the Prophet toperil, upon my own personal strength and skill, that which Ihold securely by the superiority of my forces.??If not for Jerusalem, then,? said Richard, in the tone of 333Sir Walter Scottone who would entreat a favour of an intimate friend, ?yet,for the love of honour, let us run at least three courses withgrinded lances???Even this,? said Saladin, half smiling at Coeur de Lion?saffectionate earnestness for the combat??even this I maynot lawfully do. The master places the shepherd over theflock not for the shepherd?s own sake, but for the sake of thesheep. Had I a son to hold the sceptre when I fell, I mighthave had the liberty, as I have the will, to brave this boldencounter; but your own Scripture saith that when the herds-man is smitten, the sheep are scattered.??Thou hast had all the fortune,? said Richard, turning tothe Earl of Huntingdon with a sigh. ?I would have given thebest year in my life for that one half hour beside the Dia-mond of the Desert!?The chivalrous extravagance of Richard awakened the spiritsof the assembly, and when at length they arose to departSaladin advanced and took Coeur de Lion by the hand.?Noble King of England,? he said, ?we now part, never tomeet again. That your league is dissolved, no more to be re-united, and that your native forces are far too few to enableyou to prosecute your enterprise, is as well known to me as toyourself. I may not yield you up that Jerusalem which you somuch desire to hold?it is to us, as to you, a Holy City. Butwhatever other terms Richard demands of Saladin shall be aswillingly yielded as yonder fountain yields its waters. Ay andthe same should be as frankly afforded by Saladin if Richardstood in the desert with but two archers in his train!?The next day saw Richard?s return to his own camp, andin a short space afterwards the young Earl of Huntingdonwas espoused by Edith Plantagenet. The Soldan sent, as anuptial present on this occasion, the celebrated Talisman.But though many cures were wrought by means of it in Eu-rope, none equalled in success and celebrity those which theSoldan achieved. It is still in existence, having been be-queathed by the Earl of Huntingdon to a brave knight ofScotland, Sir Simon of the Lee, in whose ancient and highlyhonoured family it is still preserved; and although charmedstones have been dismissed from the modern Pharmacopoeia,its virtues are still applied to for stopping blood, and in casesof canine madness.Our Story closes here, as the terms on which Richard re- 334The Talismanlinquished his conquests are to be found in every history ofthe period.
